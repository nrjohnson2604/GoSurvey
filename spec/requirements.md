# Requirements Specification

> **Template.** Requirements are the concrete, testable expression of the project
> purpose in `project.md`. If a behavior is not written here, it is an
> assumption — not a requirement. Every requirement must be specific enough that
> a reviewer can render a clear **pass/fail** judgment by pointing at an
> artifact (output, log, test, profile, or code structure).

## How to write a requirement

Each requirement is a numbered block with a stable ID (`REQ-NNN`). The ID never
changes or is reused, so tasks, tests, and reviews can cite it forever.

```
### REQ-NNN — Short imperative title
- Purpose:     which project goal / user this serves
- Priority:    must | should | may          (RFC-2119 sense)
- Type:        functional | performance | quality | constraint
- Statement:   what must be true, phrased testably
- Acceptance:  the observable condition that proves it (the pass/fail test)
- Owner-layer: which architecture layer is responsible
- Status:      proposed | accepted | implemented | verified
- Revisions:   date — note
```

**Testable vs. not:**

- ✅ "Importing a malformed record logs an error and writes no value to the
  model." (observable)
- ❌ "The importer should be robust." (unmeasurable)
- ✅ "A 100k-vertex scene renders within a 16 ms frame budget on the reference
  GPU." (measurable)
- ❌ "Rendering should be fast." (opinion)

Prefer **must** sparingly; everything cannot be a must. A flood of `must`
requirements is a planning failure, not a sign of rigor.

## Functional requirements

### REQ-001 — Reject malformed input, never absorb it
- Purpose: data integrity (interoperability goal)
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: When the importer encounters a record it cannot interpret, the
  import fails for that record with a logged error; no partial or guessed value
  is written into the model.
- Acceptance: feeding a known-malformed fixture yields a logged error and the
  record is absent from the result.
- Owner-layer: IO
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: `<date>` — initial.

### REQ-002 — `<Round-trip fidelity>`
- Purpose: `<interoperability>`
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `<A file imported and re-exported reproduces source geometry within tolerance.>`
- Acceptance: `<round-trip of the reference dataset matches within CON tolerance.>`
- Owner-layer: `<IO>`
- Status: proposed
- Revisions: `<date>` — initial.

> Add functional requirements until the in-scope list in `project.md` is fully
> covered — no more, no less.

---

## Traverse measurement & adjustment requirements

> These cover the Traverse Editor's raw-measurement display and the least-squares
> closure analysis (extends FEAT-002). Numeric acceptance asserts against
> tolerance per REQ-101, never exact float equality.

### REQ-010 — Display every raw observation
- Purpose: surveyor review of field data (FEAT-002)
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: After importing a raw-data file, the editor displays every
  individual F1/F2 observation retained per leg (horizontal circle, slope
  distance, vertical/zenith angle) — not only the reduced per-leg values.
- Acceptance: importing the sample FBK shows a detail row for each F1/F2
  observation; the visible observation count equals the count in the file.
- Owner-layer: UI (data from Domain)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-10 — initial.

### REQ-011 — Per-leg observation statistics
- Purpose: blunder/quality review
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: For each leg the editor computes and displays the mean, sum, and
  standard deviation from the mean of the repeated observations (horizontal
  angle, distance, vertical angle).
- Acceptance: computed mean/sum/std-dev match an independent hand calculation
  within tolerance (REQ-101).
- Owner-layer: Domain (compute), UI (display)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-10 — initial.

### REQ-012 — Complementary distance reduction
- Purpose: show both slope and horizontal distance regardless of which was given
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: When slope distance is provided the editor computes and shows the
  horizontal distance, and when horizontal distance is provided it shows the
  slope distance, using the leg's vertical/zenith angle.
- Acceptance: complementary distance matches a hand calculation within ±0.01 ft.
- Owner-layer: Domain (compute), UI (display)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-10 — initial.

### REQ-013 — Raw measurements are protected from accidental edits
- Purpose: protect raw field data from accidental edits
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: The computed-output cells of the main editor (bearing, deltas,
  coordinates, status) are read-only, and the individual F1/F2 observation values
  are not editable from the summary grid — they can be edited only inside a leg's
  explicit per-leg expander (REQ-018). Editing raw observations requires the
  deliberate act of expanding a leg. (The summary grid's manual-entry fields —
  H.Angle, H.Dist, S.Dist, V.Angle — remain editable for legs entered by hand.)
- Acceptance: code/UI review confirms no computed-output cell is editable and no
  control is bound to an individual F1/F2 observation outside the per-leg
  expander.
- Owner-layer: UI
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-10 — initial; 2026-06-11 — scoped view-only to the
  collapsed summary; editing happens in the per-leg expander (REQ-018, ADR-003).

### REQ-014 — Closure window: unadjusted vs least-squares, side by side
- Purpose: let the surveyor compare and accept an adjustment
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A "Calculate Closure" action opens a window presenting the existing
  unadjusted closure and the least-squares result side by side, across two tabs
  (closure summary; per-observation residuals), and lets the user accept the
  least-squares result.
- Acceptance: both columns populate for a closed loop; an Accept action records
  the least-squares result as the chosen adjustment.
- Owner-layer: UI (data from Domain)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-10 — initial.

### REQ-015 — Least-squares adjustment of a closed-loop traverse
- Purpose: rigorous adjustment (FEAT-002)
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: The editor adjusts a closed-loop traverse by weighted least squares,
  using configurable a-priori standard errors (defaults: σ_angle = 5″,
  σ_dist = 0.02 ft + 2 ppm) to weight observations. Only closed loops are
  adjusted in this increment. A loop closes on the start monument, which may be
  re-observed under a suffixed name (e.g. start "KCP2" closing as "KCP2.1");
  import detects this and the closing foresight is held as the start.
- Acceptance: on a synthetic closed loop with a known injected misclosure, the
  adjusted coordinates reduce the misclosure to ~0 within tolerance (REQ-101).
- Owner-layer: Domain (compute)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-10 — initial.

### REQ-016 — Per-observation residuals
- Purpose: blunder detection
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: The closure window's residuals tab shows each observation's angular
  residual and distance residual from the least-squares adjustment.
- Acceptance: residuals match an independently worked least-squares example
  within tolerance (REQ-101).
- Owner-layer: Domain (compute), UI (display)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-10 — initial.

### REQ-018 — Editable per-leg observation sets (expander)
- Purpose: let the surveyor add, edit, or remove individual observations per leg
  and have the traverse re-derive from them (FEAT-002)
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Each leg can be expanded inline to show its observation sets as
  editable controls (per-set F1/F2 horizontal circle reading, slope distance,
  zenith angle, with per-face presence). The user can add a set and remove a set.
  Editing, adding, or removing a set re-reduces the leg from its sets — the
  leg's horizontal angle (circle reading − backsight reading), zenith angle, and
  slope distance are recomputed — and the traverse and closure update
  accordingly. Sets retain the literal field circle readings, not pre-reduced
  directions.
- Acceptance: importing the sample FBK and then editing a set's circle reading
  changes that leg's computed bearing and the loop closure; adding a set changes
  the per-leg statistics (REQ-011); removing all but one set still computes.
- Owner-layer: Domain (reduction), UI (editing)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-11 — initial (ADR-003).

### REQ-017 — Insufficient redundancy is surfaced, not absorbed
- Purpose: no silent failure (REQ-201)
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: When a traverse has insufficient redundancy for adjustment (e.g. an
  open traverse, redundancy ≤ 0) or the normal-equation system is singular, the
  closure window reports "least squares unavailable" with a reason and shows no
  adjusted values; it does not crash or emit NaN/silent results.
- Acceptance: an open traverse yields the message and no adjusted output; a
  singular system logs an error and produces no value.
- Owner-layer: Domain (compute), UI (display)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-10 — initial.

## Display & units requirements

> These cover the Drawing Units (`UNITS`) feature: how the user configures the
> precision and format of the linear and angular values the application
> **displays**. They own display formatting only — stored coordinates and the
> internal angle convention are unchanged (REQ-101 fidelity is preserved).

### REQ-020 — UNITS command and Drawing Units dialog
- Purpose: give the user one AutoCAD-style place to control displayed units
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A `UNITS` command (command line + menu) opens a modal Drawing Units
  dialog with Length, Angle, Insertion-scale, and a live Sample Output. The
  Length group (Type = Decimal; adjustable precision) is the single owner of the
  display precision for all non-survey linear/coordinate readouts, replacing the
  interim Display-tab "Coordinate precision" control. Cancel/Esc reverts to the
  values present when the dialog opened; OK applies and persists.
- Acceptance: typing `UNITS` opens the dialog; changing Length precision changes
  the ID, status-bar, dimension, and property readouts to that many decimals;
  Cancel makes no change; settings persist across restart.
- Owner-layer: UI (command + dialog), IO (persistence)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-11 — initial.

### REQ-021 — Configurable angle display
- Purpose: surveyor-appropriate bearing/angle presentation
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Non-survey angle/bearing **readouts** (INVERSE bearing, angular
  dimensions, rotation-relative-north properties, Sample Output) render according
  to a chosen angle format ∈ {Decimal Degrees, Deg/Min/Sec, Surveyor's Units},
  an adjustable precision, a direction (clockwise / counter-clockwise), and a
  base angle. This governs **display only**: typing an angle into a command keeps
  the existing CW-from-north entry convention. At default settings the rendered
  output matches the pre-feature bearing format.
- Acceptance: Surveyor's Units renders a representative bearing as `N 45°30'00" E`;
  Decimal Degrees and DMS render correctly at the chosen precision; changing
  direction/base changes displayed values consistently across readouts and Sample
  Output; angle entry is unchanged; a parity test confirms default-settings output
  equals the previous formatter (assert against tolerance per REQ-101 where
  numeric).
- Owner-layer: Domain (pure formatter), UI (readouts + dialog)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-11 — initial.

### REQ-022 — Drawing unit (INSUNITS-style relabel), persisted to .gs and DXF
- Purpose: tell the drawing what unit it is in, AutoCAD-faithfully, without ever
  altering geometry
- Priority: may
- Type: functional
- Statement: The Drawing Units dialog sets the drawing's unit — Unitless, Feet,
  or Meters — as a **relabel only**, mirroring AutoCAD's INSUNITS: it never
  scales, converts, or otherwise alters any coordinate, length, survey point, or
  text height. The unit is a **document property**: it is persisted in the `.gs`
  file and written to the DXF `$INSUNITS` header on export (Feet=2, Meters=6,
  Unitless=0). On DXF import, a present `$INSUNITS` sets the drawing's unit but
  coordinates are read **unscaled** (1:1), so round-trip fidelity (REQ-002) is
  preserved. Display precision and angle-format settings remain app-global user
  prefs and are unaffected; survey-point display precision remains independent.
- Acceptance: changing the unit changes no coordinate anywhere; export writes
  `$INSUNITS` matching the unit; importing a DXF that carries `$INSUNITS` adopts
  the unit with coordinates unchanged (a known point exported then re-imported is
  identical within REQ-101 tolerance); a `.gs` save/load preserves the unit;
  survey-point precision is unaffected.
- Owner-layer: UI (dialog), IO (DXF + .gs persistence)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-11 — initial (stored-only, user-pref). 2026-06-12 — amended
  to an INSUNITS relabel persisted in .gs/DXF; no geometry scaling (decision log).

### REQ-023 — Survey points survive a DXF round-trip
- Purpose: DXF is a safe interchange/backup for survey data, not just `.gs`
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A GoSurvey drawing exported to DXF and re-imported reconstructs its
  survey points with identity intact — id, easting, northing, elevation,
  description, layer, and label style — and re-links each point's label. Identity
  is carried in DXF XDATA under a registered `GOSURVEY` application id; a `POINT`
  without that XDATA (e.g. from another program) still imports as a snappable
  cross-line marker, so foreign-point behavior is unchanged. Coordinates
  round-trip within REQ-101 tolerance (the existing world-origin translation is
  preserved; nothing is scaled).
  DXF import replaces the **CAD geometry** but **preserves survey points already
  in the session** (so importing points then a DXF, or a DXF then points, both
  keep all points); the DXF's reconstructed survey points are **merged** with the
  existing ones. Points are stored in local space (`world = local +
  worldDocumentOrigin`), so import converts each merged point into the document's
  current local frame. When an imported point's id does not collide it is added
  directly; when it collides with an existing point the user is prompted to either
  **overwrite** the existing point or **offset** the imported ids by a chosen
  amount.
- Acceptance: a drawing with N survey points exported then re-imported yields N
  survey points with matching id, coordinates (within REQ-101), description, and
  label style; each reconstructed point has a single linked label (no duplicate or
  orphan MTEXT); a `POINT` from a non-GoSurvey DXF still imports as cross-lines.
  Importing a DXF while M survey points already exist keeps all M (they remain on
  the linework in world coordinates) and adds the DXF's non-colliding points; a
  colliding id triggers the overwrite/offset prompt rather than dropping or
  silently duplicating a point.
- Owner-layer: IO (DXF)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-12 — initial (resolves issue #37). 2026-06-15 — amended: DXF
  import preserves existing session survey points and merges reconstructed points,
  with an overwrite/offset prompt on id conflict (decision log).

### REQ-024 — AutoCAD-style dynamic input at the cursor for point prompts
- Purpose: familiar, readable coordinate entry that matches AutoCAD dynamic input
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: When the active command prompt expects a coordinate point, the
  cursor dynamic-input shows a prompt label plus a **single coordinate field**
  that continuously displays the crosshair's current **world** coordinates
  (`x,y`) at the configured display precision (REQ-020 `displayLinearPrecision`).
  Typing overrides (locks) the field to the typed value; the field accepts any
  point input the command line understands — absolute `x,y`, relative `@dx,dy`,
  bearing/distance, etc. Enter — or a viewport click — commits the point. Prompts
  that do not expect a point (bearing/angle/distance/option/command-name entry)
  likewise keep a single input field. There is no Send button; commit is by Enter
  or click.

  **One stated exception — directional prompts (REQ-154).** The UCS X-axis and
  XY-plane prompts, and the second point of `UCS <axis> 2P`, show a **polar pair**
  instead: a distance field and an angle field, rendered as `<distance> < <angle>`.
  Those prompts ask for a DIRECTION, and an `x,y` readout answers a different
  question — the user would have to do the subtraction themselves to learn the
  angle the prompt is about. The pair assembles `@<distance><<angle>`, which is
  real syntax the command line accepts, so the two forms describe the same thing
  and either can be typed. The angle is measured in the active UCS's XY plane from
  its +X, the same reference `UCS <axis> 2P` uses. This exception is deliberately
  narrow: it does not reopen the 2026-06-19 decision for any other prompt.
- Acceptance: starting LINE shows the "first point" prompt with a single box that
  tracks the cursor's easting/northing as `x,y`; typing locks the field; entering
  `@dx,dy` or a bearing/distance places the relative point; Enter commits the
  shown/typed value and a viewport click still places the point; a non-point
  prompt (e.g. circle radius, bearing entry) also shows a single field.
- Owner-layer: UI
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-12 — initial; 2026-06-19 — single coordinate field instead
  of two X/Y boxes, so relative/bearing/distance entry works in the same field.
  2026-08-29 — a stated exception for the UCS directional prompts (REQ-154): a
  polar distance/angle pair there, single field everywhere else.

### REQ-025 — Model and Paper space with layout tabs and a space toggle
- Purpose: compose a model onto sheets, the way AutoCAD model/paper space works
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Each drawing has a **Model space** (today's modeling area) and zero or
  more named **Paper space layouts**. The UI shows a tab/selector to switch the
  active space, and layouts can be **added, renamed, and deleted**. A status-bar
  button reads **MODEL** or **PAPER** for the active space and **clicking it
  toggles** between model space and the current/last paper layout. Switching space
  changes what the viewport edits and displays; model geometry is unaffected by
  paper-space edits.
- Acceptance: a drawing shows a Model entry plus at least one Paper layout entry;
  switching changes the active space; ≥2 layouts can be added, renamed, and deleted
  and coexist; the status button shows MODEL/PAPER and clicking it toggles the
  active space.
- Owner-layer: UI / Domain
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-15 — initial (Paper Space milestone, decision log).

### REQ-026 — Sheet definition: paper size and orientation
- Purpose: a layout represents a real sheet of paper
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A paper layout has a selectable **paper size** (a preset set covering
  common ANSI A–E and ARCH sizes, plus a custom width×height) and **orientation**
  (portrait/landscape). The sheet outline (and printable margin, if modeled)
  renders in paper space at the chosen physical size.
- Acceptance: choosing a size + orientation renders the sheet outline at that
  physical size in paper space; changing the size updates the outline.
- Owner-layer: UI / Domain
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-15 — initial.

### REQ-027 — Layout viewports at independent scales
- Purpose: show one or more scaled views of the model on a sheet
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A paper layout may hold **one or more viewports**, each a rectangular
  window onto **model space** with its own **scale** and **pan/center**. Viewports
  can be **created, moved, resized**, and have their scale set (model units per
  paper unit). Model geometry renders inside each viewport clipped to its rectangle
  at the viewport's scale; the model itself is unchanged.
- Acceptance: the user can add a viewport and set its scale and model geometry
  appears inside it at that scale; a layout can hold ≥2 viewports showing the model
  at **different** scales simultaneously; viewports can be moved and resized.
- Owner-layer: UI / Domain / Renderer
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-15 — initial.

### REQ-028 — Per-viewport layer freeze
- Purpose: control which layers show in each viewport independently
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Each viewport carries its own set of **frozen layers**. A layer frozen
  in a viewport is hidden **only in that viewport** — not in other viewports, other
  layouts, or model space.
- Acceptance: freezing a layer in one viewport hides its geometry in that viewport
  while it remains visible in other viewports and in model space; thawing restores
  it.
- Owner-layer: UI / Domain / Renderer
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-15 — initial. 2026-07-13 — the freeze **UI** moved from the standalone
  "Frozen Layers" panel to the Layer Manager's **VP Freeze** column and the **VPFREEZE/VPTHAW**
  commands (REQ-046); the per-viewport freeze data model and semantics are unchanged. 2026-07-13
  — plotted output now honors per-viewport frozen layers (TASK-017), matching the on-screen render.

### REQ-029 — Plot a single layout to PDF at true scale
- Purpose: produce a printable sheet at correct plot scale
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: The user can **plot a single paper layout to a PDF** sized to the
  layout's paper size, with geometry placed at **true plot scale** (1:1 on the
  sheet; each viewport's model content at the viewport's scale). Output is vector
  where practical, produced with the already-bundled PDFium edit API (ADR-006) — no
  new dependency.
- Acceptance: plotting a layout produces a one-page PDF at the layout's paper size
  where a measured distance on the sheet matches the intended plot scale within
  REQ-101 tolerance.
- Owner-layer: IO / Renderer
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-15 — initial.

### REQ-030 — Batch plot multiple layouts
- Purpose: plot many sheets in one action
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: The user can select **multiple paper layouts** and plot them in one
  action to a **multi-page PDF** (one page per layout), each at its own paper size
  and true plot scale (REQ-029).
- Acceptance: selecting ≥2 layouts and batch-plotting produces a single multi-page
  PDF with one correctly sized/scaled page per selected layout.
- Owner-layer: IO / Renderer
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-15 — initial.

### REQ-031 — Persist layouts and viewports in .gs
- Purpose: layouts survive save/reload
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Paper layouts, their paper size/orientation, their viewports
  (rectangle, scale, center) and per-viewport frozen layers are **persisted in the
  native `.gs` file** and restored on load. DXF persistence of layouts/viewports is
  **deferred** to a later requirement (decision log, 2026-06-15).
- Acceptance: a drawing with multiple layouts and viewports (with set scales, paper
  sizes, and per-viewport frozen layers) saved to `.gs` then reloaded restores all
  of them identically.
- Owner-layer: IO
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-15 — initial.

### REQ-032 — Contextual "Layout" ribbon in paper space
- Purpose: surface paper-space commands only when they apply
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: While a paper layout is the active space, the ribbon presents a
  **Layout** context with the paper-space commands (rectangular viewport, polygonal
  viewport, and future paper-space tools); in model space the normal ribbon shows.
- Acceptance: switching to a paper layout shows the Layout ribbon with the viewport
  commands; switching back to Model restores the normal ribbon.
- Owner-layer: UI
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-15 — initial (Paper Space Inc 3a).

### REQ-033 — Rectangular viewport command with live preview
- Purpose: create viewports by drawing them, like AutoCAD MVIEW
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A command (ribbon **Layout → Rectangular Viewport**, or a command-line
  alias) lets the user create a viewport on the active layout with **two clicks**
  defining opposite corners, showing a **rubber-band preview** between the first
  click and the cursor. The new viewport defaults to a sensible scale/center, then
  is editable (REQ-027). Esc cancels before the second click.
- Acceptance: starting the command then clicking two corners creates a viewport of
  that rectangle showing the model; a preview rectangle tracks the cursor between
  clicks; Esc before the second click creates nothing.
- Owner-layer: UI / Commands
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-15 — initial (Inc 3a).

### REQ-034 — Polygonal viewport command  *(WITHDRAWN)*
- Purpose: non-rectangular viewports
- Priority: could
- Type: functional
- Statement: A command lets the user define a viewport boundary by clicking
  **vertices until "close"**, with a preview; the viewport clips the model to that
  polygon. Polygonal clipping depends on the GL viewport render pass (ADR-006 /
  ADR-008), so this lands after that pass exists.
- Acceptance: clicking ≥3 vertices then closing creates a viewport that clips the
  model to the polygon; preview tracks the in-progress boundary.
- Owner-layer: UI / Commands / Renderer
- Status: **withdrawn** (2026-07-13 — see decision log). Never implemented.
- Revisions: 2026-06-15 — initial (Inc 3d; depends on the GL clip pass).
  2026-07-13 — **withdrawn**: rectangular viewports (REQ-033) cover current needs;
  polygonal viewports were blocked on the deferred/reverted GL per-viewport clip
  pass and judged unneeded complexity. May be re-proposed if a real need arises.

### REQ-035 — Viewports are selectable; MOVE/COPY/DELETE operate on them
- Purpose: edit viewports with the same UX as model objects
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: In paper space, viewports are **selectable objects** (single click and
  window selection, with grips), and the **MOVE**, **COPY**, and **DELETE** commands
  operate on the selected viewport(s) — mirroring model-space selection/editing.
- Acceptance: clicking a viewport selects it (window-select selects those inside);
  MOVE relocates it, COPY duplicates it, DELETE removes it; grips move/resize it.
- Owner-layer: UI / Commands
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-15 — initial (Inc 3b).

### REQ-036 — Floating model space (edit the model through a viewport)
- Purpose: AutoCAD-style MSPACE — work in model space inside a viewport on the sheet
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: **Double-clicking a viewport** enters **floating model space**: the
  viewport becomes the active model view and model **draw/edit/snap commands operate
  through the viewport's transform**, clipped to its boundary. Double-clicking
  outside (or Esc, or a PSPACE toggle) returns to paper space. The viewport's
  scale/center reflect the navigation done while active.
- Acceptance: double-clicking a viewport activates it; drawing/snapping/editing apply
  to model space (visible at the viewport's scale, clipped to its rect); leaving the
  viewport returns to paper space with the model unchanged outside the viewport edits.
- Owner-layer: UI / Commands / Renderer
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-15 — initial (Inc 3c).

### REQ-037 — Native paper-space geometry (annotations / title blocks)
- Purpose: draw and edit geometry that lives on the sheet itself — title blocks,
  notes, borders — independent of model space and of viewport content
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A paper layout owns its own set of **paper-space entities**, stored in
  **paper inches** with the sheet origin at (0,0) and **separate** from model-space
  geometry and from the model content shown inside viewports. The first version
  supports **lines and text** (extensible to polylines/circles/arcs). When a paper
  layout is the active space **and not in floating model space**, the standard
  **draw** (line, text) and **edit** (move, copy, rotate, delete) commands and
  **object snapping** operate on that layout's paper-space entities — mirroring the
  model-space UX. Survey-specific tools (survey points, CSV import) remain
  **model-only**. Snapping in paper space resolves to **paper-space entities only**
  (snapping to viewport-displayed model geometry is deferred). Paper-space entities
  **persist per layout in the native `.gs` file** and are unaffected by model edits.
- Acceptance: in a paper layout the user can draw lines and place text on the sheet;
  each can be moved/copied/rotated/deleted and snapped to; they do **not** appear in
  model space or in other layouts; a drawing with paper-space entities saved to `.gs`
  then reloaded restores them per layout.
- Owner-layer: Domain / UI / Commands / Renderer / IO
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-16 — initial (Paper Space Inc 5; SPEC GAP resolution, ADR-009).

### REQ-038 — Clipboard copy/paste within and across model & paper space
- Purpose: reuse existing geometry — e.g. copy a DXF title block from model space
  onto a paper-space sheet layout — and duplicate by copy/paste like AutoCAD
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: **Ctrl+C** copies the **active space's** current selection (model
  entities when model/floating-model space is active; the active paper layout's
  entities when a paper layout is active) into an in-process clipboard. **Ctrl+V**
  begins an **interactive paste**: a live preview tracks the cursor and a single
  viewport click places the copied entities **into the currently active space** at
  the click point. Crossing spaces uses **1:1 raw units** — coordinates transfer
  verbatim (model local units ↔ paper inches) with **no scale conversion**; this is
  an explicit, user-initiated coordinate transfer (the sanctioned exception to
  ADR-009's "no implicit coordinate-space mixing"). Pasted entities become the new
  active-space selection (immediately editable) and preserve their properties
  (layer, color, linetype, text style/typeface). Copy/paste works **model→paper,
  paper→model, and within the same space**. **Ctrl+V with an empty clipboard does
  nothing** (no crash). Survey points and survey-specific tools remain model-only.
  The clipboard is in-memory only (not persisted; DXF persistence of the new paper
  types stays deferred per the ADR-013 amendment).
- Acceptance: (1) a model-space selection + Ctrl+C, switch to a paper layout +
  Ctrl+V shows a cursor-tracking preview and a click places the copies in paper
  space; (2) the reverse (paper→model) works the same way; (3) same-space copy/paste
  produces a duplicate placed by click; (4) a copied DXF title block (lines + text,
  plus any circle/arc) appears on the sheet with geometry intact; (5) pasted entities
  are the active selection immediately after placement; (6) they keep layer, color,
  and text style; (7) Ctrl+V with an empty clipboard is a no-op; (8) crossing spaces
  uses 1:1 raw units (a copied known length transfers numerically unchanged).

### REQ-039 — Paper-space objects have full model-space parity
- Purpose: paper space is a peer object space, not a second-class one — the user edits a
  sheet's native geometry with the exact UX they use in model space (the user asked for
  full parity)
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: While a paper layout is the active space and **not** in floating model space,
  the layout's native paper-space objects (lines, text, circles, arcs, ellipses, polylines —
  REQ-037/038, ADR-009/013) support the **same** interaction surface as model-space objects:
  (a) **selection** — single click (Shift to add/toggle) and **window/crossing box** selection
  using the same left-to-right=window / right-to-left=crossing rule, with hover pre-highlight;
  (b) **grips** — selected objects show grips whose drag edits geometry, mirroring model grips
  (line endpoints/midpoint, circle center/quadrants, arc, ellipse, polyline vertices, text
  insertion); (c) the **Properties panel** shows and **edits** the selected paper object(s) —
  General (layer/color/linetype/lineweight/transparency) and per-type Geometry and Text
  (contents/height/rotation/style) — the same panel used for model selection; (d) **object
  snapping** to paper objects; (e) **draw** commands LINE, TEXT, MTEXT, CIRCLE, ARC, ELLIPSE,
  POLYLINE create into the active layout's paper store (paper inches); (f) **modify** commands
  MOVE, COPY, ROTATE, SCALE, DELETE, JOIN, TRIM, OFFSET operate on the paper selection.
  Additionally, **double-clicking a text object opens an in-place editor** to edit its
  contents — implemented for **both** model space and paper space (the same shared editor).
  Survey-specific tools (survey points, CSV import) remain **model-only**; paper edits never
  alter model geometry; coordinates never cross spaces implicitly (REQ-038's 1:1 paste is the
  one sanctioned exception). Paper-space objects and their edits **persist per layout in the
  native `.gs`** (REQ-031/037 pattern); DXF persistence of paper objects stays deferred.
- Acceptance: in a paper layout — (1) a window box (L→R) selects paper objects fully inside it
  and a crossing box (R→L) selects any it touches, for every paper object type; (2) clicking a
  paper text selects it with no vertical offset, and double-clicking any text (model or paper)
  opens an inline editor whose committed text replaces the object's contents; (3) selecting
  paper object(s) populates the Properties panel and edits made there apply to the object(s);
  (4) selected paper objects show grips and dragging a grip edits the geometry; (5) CIRCLE,
  ARC, ELLIPSE, POLYLINE, and MTEXT draw onto the sheet, and SCALE/JOIN/TRIM/OFFSET operate on
  the paper selection; (6) none of these paper edits change model geometry; (7) a `.gs`
  round-trip restores the edited paper objects per layout.

### REQ-040 — AutoCAD-style floating command line with fading history and an F2 console
- Purpose: the command line should read and behave like AutoCAD's — a compact
  floating input over the drawing, a brief glance at recent prompts, and an
  expandable text console — without sacrificing the existing input affordances
  (the user asked for this redesign from reference screenshots)
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: In addition to the existing dockable "Command line" window (which
  **remains available** via a toggle), the application provides a **compact
  floating command bar** overlaid on the drawing area, anchored bottom-center by
  default, **draggable**, with its on-screen position and visibility **persisted**
  across sessions (UserPrefs, the `UserPrefs`/`AppCommandState` settings pattern —
  no new global). The bar carries: a drag grip, a **close (×)** control that hides
  the bar, a **settings (wrench)** control that opens command-line settings (fade
  delay, opacity, history-line count), a prompt glyph with a **history dropdown**
  of recently entered commands, the **command input** (placeholder "Type a
  command"), and an **expand** control. When hidden, the bar is restored by
  **Ctrl+9** and/or a View-menu toggle. After commands run, the **last few**
  (default 3, configurable) command-log lines float **above** the input on
  semi-transparent backgrounds and **fade out** after a configurable idle delay
  (default ~4 s). **F2 toggles** an **expanded console** that shows the recent log
  (default ~15 visible lines, scrollable through the full log) on a near-opaque
  background and stays until F2 is pressed again. **ESC always cancels the active
  command** and never closes the console. Console/history text is **selectable and
  copyable** (replacing the prior "Copy log" button). The redesign **preserves**:
  the command-name autocomplete popup, the at-crosshair dynamic-cursor input
  (REQ-024), and the clickable `[A]`/`[2P]` footer hints.
- Acceptance: (1) on launch a compact floating bar shows at bottom-center with the
  "Type a command" placeholder, can be dragged, and its position/visibility are
  restored next session; (2) running commands makes the last ~3 log lines appear
  above the bar and fade out after the idle delay; (3) F2 expands the console
  (recent lines, scrollable) and F2 again collapses it; (4) ESC cancels the active
  command whether or not the console is open; (5) console/history text can be
  selected with the mouse and copied; (6) × hides the bar and Ctrl+9 (or the menu)
  restores it; (7) autocomplete, the dynamic-cursor input, and the clickable
  `[A]`/`[2P]` hints still work; (8) the dockable Command line window is still
  available.
- Owner-layer: UI
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-19 — initial (floating command bar + fading history + F2
  console; ADR-015). 2026-06-19 — the active command's hint is the prompt rendered
  **in the input line** (replacing the placeholder), with `[token]` markers shown as
  **clickable links** that submit the option (the standard for any command offering
  keyword options); idle shows a "Type a command" placeholder. 2026-06-19 — the bar is
  **pinned to the viewport bottom edge** (vertical position locked); the user slides it
  left/right and resizes its **width** (right-edge grip) and the F2 console **height**
  (top-edge grip); position/width/console-height persist.

### REQ-041 — Import Points pre-import validation with specific diagnostics
- Purpose: data integrity and no silent failure for CSV point import, surfaced to
  the user before import (serves the import goal; the UI expression of REQ-001 /
  REQ-201 — the user asked to know *why* a file will not import)
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: The Import points window validates the selected file **before any
  import** and surfaces specific, actionable diagnostics. It distinguishes and
  names file-state failures — **file not found**, **file is empty**, and **file
  exists but cannot be opened** (e.g. open/locked in another application) — with
  distinct messages, not one generic read error. The validation summary flags
  **duplicate point IDs** both **within the file** (naming the ID and the
  conflicting line numbers) and **against survey points already in the session**
  (naming the ID and line), in addition to the existing per-row column/number/ID
  parse errors. The summary shows an **overall status**: "Ready to import — N
  point(s)" when importable, or "Cannot import — <reason>" when a file-level
  problem blocks it. **File-level problems** (not found, empty, unreadable/locked,
  or zero valid rows) **disable the Import action**. When **only row-level
  problems** exist, Import remains enabled but pressing it first **asks the user to
  confirm** importing the N valid rows and skipping the M bad rows before any
  change is made. A skipped row still writes no partial or guessed value into the
  model (REQ-001 preserved). This is a display/validation layer over the existing
  importer; stored coordinates, the local-storage invariant, and import behavior
  for accepted rows are unchanged.
- Acceptance:
  - selecting a path that does not exist shows "File not found"; an **empty** file
    shows "File is empty"; a file **open/locked in another application** shows a
    message naming that it could not be opened (not a generic error); in all three
    the Import action is **disabled**;
  - a file containing a **duplicate ID within itself** shows "Duplicate point ID N
    (line X and line Y)"; a file whose ID equals an **existing session point**
    shows "Point ID N already exists in the drawing (line X)";
  - a fully valid file shows "Ready to import — N point(s)" and Import is enabled;
  - **(added 2026-08-17, revision 3)** once an import has **run**, the summary reports
    **what that import did** — "Imported N point(s) — M row(s) skipped." — and the
    panel does **not** re-validate the file it just imported. Import is disabled,
    because the file's rows are now in the drawing, and the summary says so rather
    than presenting it as a failure: a completed import never renders as an error
    colour and never shows the "Cannot import" wording. The outcome stands until the
    user changes the path, the column order, or the header setting — any of which
    resumes normal pre-import validation;
  - a file with **only row-level problems** shows the per-row messages, keeps
    Import enabled, and pressing Import **prompts to confirm** importing the valid
    rows and skipping the bad rows before any change;
  - a skipped row writes no value into the model (REQ-001 preserved).
- Owner-layer: UI (window, overall status, confirm prompt), IO (file-state
  classification, duplicate/parse diagnostics)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-20 — initial. 2026-06-20 — for PENZD layouts the trailing
  description column is **optional**: a P,N,E,Z row (4 columns, no description) is a
  valid point and imports with an empty description (a missing description is no
  longer flagged as "too few columns"). 2026-06-20 — **elevation (Z) is also
  optional**: the required minimum is the ID (if present) plus the two horizontal
  coordinates (P,N,E for PENZD; N,E/E,N for NEZ/ENZ); a missing or blank Z defaults
  to 0. A Z that is present but unparseable is still an error (REQ-001).
  2026-08-17 (revision 3) — **what the panel shows *after* an import was never
  specified, and the unspecified behaviour was wrong.** The importer marked the
  preview dirty on completion, so the panel immediately re-validated the same file
  against a session that now contained the points that import had just created —
  and reported a successful import of 5 points as "Cannot import — no valid data
  rows", in red, with a duplicate-ID error for every row. Every statement in it was
  literally true of a *second* import and every one of them was misleading about the
  first. Recorded as a requirement revision rather than a quiet fix because the gap
  was in the spec: REQ-041 defined the pre-import states exhaustively and said
  nothing about the state after, so the code was not violating it. See BUG-014,
  TASK-069, D-2026-08-17-d.

### REQ-042 — Hatch fills are selectable, editable entities
- Purpose: a hatch (imported `SOLID` `HATCH` → `CadFilledRegion`, ADR-011, or one created by
  REQ-043) must be a first-class object the user can pick and remove/transform, not a stuck
  background fill (the user could not select or delete imported hatches)
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Solid filled regions (`CadFilledRegion`) become a selectable entity type
  (`SelectedEntity::Type::FilledRegion`), with the same interaction surface as other CAD
  objects in model space: (a) **single-click pick** — clicking anywhere **inside** the fill
  (point-in-polygon against the outer loop, **excluding** hole loops) selects it, with Shift to
  add/toggle and a **hover pre-highlight**; (b) **window/crossing box** selection (same
  L→R=window / R→L=crossing rule) — a fill is hit when its loops are inside the window box, or
  the box crosses/contains it for crossing; (c) a **selection highlight** that reads clearly
  over the fill; (d) **DELETE** removes the selected fill(s); (e) **MOVE** and **COPY**
  translate the fill (all loop vertices) and (COPY) clipboard-paste it, replacing the prior
  bbox-enclosure copy heuristic for directly selected fills (ADR-013 addendum) with true
  selection; every such edit is **undoable** and persists through `.gs` (REQ-031/ADR-011) and
  the existing `HATCH` DXF export. Rotate/scale/mirror/grips for fills are **out of scope** for
  this requirement (a later REQ). Pattern hatches that import as boundary **outlines** are
  already selectable as their line entities and are unaffected.
- Acceptance:
  - clicking inside an imported solid hatch selects and highlights it; clicking outside it (or
    inside one of its holes) does not;
  - a window box that encloses the fill selects it; a crossing box that touches it selects it;
  - hovering a fill shows a pre-highlight;
  - DELETE removes the selected fill and **Undo** restores it (geometry + color + layer);
  - MOVE relocates the fill and Undo restores the original position; COPY + paste produces an
    offset duplicate; a `.gs` round-trip restores the result;
  - existing selection of lines/circles/arcs/etc. and existing hatch fill rendering are unchanged.
- Owner-layer: Commands / Domain / UI / Renderer / IO
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-20 — initial (ADR-016; amends ADR-013 addendum "fills aren't a selectable
  entity type").

### REQ-043 — HATCH command with internal-point boundary detection, live preview, patterns, and a dynamic ribbon
- Purpose: the user can fill a region bounded by existing geometry by picking an internal point
  (AutoCAD `HATCH`/`BHATCH` pick-point workflow), choosing pattern and appearance, and seeing a
  live preview (the user asked for a HATCH command)
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A **HATCH** command fills a closed region of existing geometry. (a) **Internal
  point** — the command prompts for a point inside the area to hatch. (b) **Boundary
  detection** — from the candidate point the command traces the **smallest closed loop** that
  encloses it, built from a planar graph of nearby boundary geometry (lines, polylines, arcs,
  circles); arcs/circles are tessellated for the trace. If **no closed region** contains the
  point, the command reports it and places nothing (REQ-201 — no silent failure, no guessed
  fill). (c) **Live preview** — while the cursor is inside a detected region the candidate fill
  is previewed with the active pattern/appearance; outside any region no preview shows. (d)
  **Placement** — clicking inside a detected region creates a hatch filling it; the created
  hatch is a `CadFilledRegion` (REQ-042 — immediately selectable/movable/deletable) and persists
  (`.gs`, `HATCH` DXF export). (e) **Patterns** — the hatch may be **SOLID** or a line **pattern**
  (e.g. ANSI31) rendered clipped to the boundary and driven by **angle** and **scale**; pattern
  name + angle + scale are stored on the region. (f) **Dynamic ribbon tab** — while HATCH is
  active a contextual ribbon tab (the ADR-008 contextual-ribbon pattern) shows hatch-type
  **thumbnail** swatches (a **placeholder** set this pass) and **live** controls for **color**,
  **transparency**, **layer**, **angle**, and **scale** that apply to the hatch being created.
- Acceptance:
  - running HATCH prompts for an internal point;
  - moving the cursor **inside** a closed region shows a preview fill; moving it where no closed
    region contains it shows **no** preview;
  - clicking inside a detected region creates a hatch that exactly fills that region;
  - if the point is in no closed region, the command reports "no closed boundary found" and
    creates nothing;
  - the created hatch honors the ribbon's selected pattern, angle, scale, color, transparency,
    and layer;
  - the created hatch is immediately selectable/deletable/movable (REQ-042) and survives a `.gs`
    round-trip.
- Owner-layer: Commands (command + boundary trace) / Renderer (pattern fill + preview) / UI
  (dynamic ribbon) / Domain+IO (pattern fields on `CadFilledRegion`)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-20 — initial. ADR-017 (boundary tracing), ADR-018 (pattern storage +
  rendering; amends ADR-011 "solid fills only"), ADR-019 (dynamic HATCH ribbon; extends ADR-008).
  Delivered incrementally: Phase 2 = command + trace + preview + SOLID + ribbon (color/
  transparency/layer live); Phase 3 = line patterns driven by angle/scale + thumbnails.

### REQ-044 — Named text styles (create/manage, live reference with per-text overrides)
- Purpose: let the user define and reuse AutoCAD-style named text formatting instead of the
  single de-facto font/height — the user asked to create text styles like AutoCAD and switch
  between them
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A drawing owns a table of named **text styles**, each defining **font**, **height**
  (plotted inches), **oblique angle**, and **bold/italic**. (Color is **not** a style property —
  it remains a layer/object property edited in the Properties panel, matching AutoCAD STYLE.) A
  default style **"Standard"** always exists and cannot be deleted. The user **creates, renames,
  deletes, and edits** styles in a **management dialog** (AutoCAD STYLE-like) and selects the
  **active** style from a **dropdown**; newly created text adopts the active style. Each text
  object keeps a **live reference** to its style: **editing a style updates every text using it**,
  **except** properties the user has **overridden** on specific selected text via the Properties
  panel (font, height, oblique, bold/italic — each overridable independently). **Switching the
  active style affects only newly created text**, never existing text. Text styles and each text's
  style reference + overrides **persist in the native `.gs` file**; **older `.gs` files load with
  every existing text rendered exactly as before** (text with no style reference resolves from its
  own stored fields). **DXF import registers the drawing's STYLE table as live text styles**: each DXF
  `STYLE` record becomes a named text style (font + oblique/italic), and every imported TEXT/MTEXT holds a
  **live reference** to its style (DXF group 7), so editing that style updates the imported text — the same
  as native text. The imported per-text **height is a per-text override** (DXF group 40), so a style edit
  changes font/oblique, not each label's height. A pre-existing drawing style is never clobbered (an unset
  font is filled from the DXF; a user-set font is kept). Stored coordinates, the local-storage invariant,
  and all non-text behavior are unchanged.
- Acceptance:
  - creating a style in the dialog, setting it active, then drawing text produces text in that
    style's font/height/oblique/bold/italic;
  - switching the active style changes only **new** text; existing text is unchanged;
  - **editing a style** updates every text referencing it, except properties overridden on
    specific text;
  - overriding font/height/oblique (or color, via the existing General color) on selected text in
    the Properties panel changes only that text and survives a later edit of its style;
  - saving and reloading a `.gs` file preserves all styles and each text's reference + overrides;
  - opening an **older** `.gs` file leaves every existing text visually unchanged;
  - **importing a DXF** registers its STYLE table as text styles, and editing an imported style's font
    updates every imported TEXT/MTEXT that references it (heights unchanged, being per-text overrides).
- Owner-layer: Domain (style table + resolution) / UI (dialog, dropdown, Properties) / IO (.gs)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-21 — initial (ADR-020). Delivered incrementally: Phase 1 = data model +
  Standard + active-style dropdown + create path + `.gs` persistence; Phase 2 = STYLE management
  dialog (create/rename/delete/edit + re-bake referencing text); Phase 3 = Properties per-text
  overrides + oblique rendering. 2026-07-29 — DXF STYLE-table round-trip un-deferred: import now
  registers the STYLE table as live text styles and links imported TEXT/MTEXT to them (imported height
  is a per-text override); editing an imported style's font ripples to the imported text.

### REQ-045 — PAN command (interactive view pan via the command line)
- Purpose: AutoCAD-style typed panning — the user asked for a PAN command because only
  middle-mouse drag panned the view
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A `PAN` command (alias `P`), recognized at the command line like every other
  command, enters an interactive **pan mode**: the cursor becomes a **hand** and dragging with
  the **left** mouse button pans the active view 1:1 with the cursor. Pressing **Esc**,
  **Enter**, or **right-clicking** exits pan mode and restores the prior cursor and active tool.
  Pan mode operates in model space, paper space, and floating model space, reusing the **same
  view transform** as the existing middle-mouse-drag pan — which continues to work unchanged.
  This is a UI-layer interaction over the existing view pan; no geometry, coordinate, or storage
  behavior changes (REQ-101 fidelity untouched).
- Acceptance:
  - typing `PAN` or `P` enters pan mode and the cursor changes to a hand;
  - left-mouse drag moves the view by the drag delta (1:1) in the active space;
  - Esc, Enter, or right-click exits pan mode and restores the prior cursor and active tool;
  - existing middle-mouse-drag pan still works unchanged;
  - pan mode works in both model space and floating/paper space.
- Owner-layer: UI
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-06-21 — initial.

### REQ-046 — Per-viewport layer overrides: VP Freeze + VP Color in the Layer Manager, and VPFREEZE/VPTHAW commands
- Purpose: AutoCAD-style per-viewport layer control — the user manages how each layer
  appears **in a given viewport** (frozen or recolored) from the Layer Manager and by
  picking objects, replacing the ad-hoc "Frozen Layers" panel
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Per-viewport layer state is controlled two ways, both targeting the **current
  viewport** — defined as the **floating** viewport when the user is inside one (REQ-036),
  else the **single selected** viewport in paper space, else **none** (controls disabled).
  (a) **Layer Manager columns** — the LAYER manager gains a **VP Freeze** column (checkbox)
  that freezes/thaws the row's layer in the current viewport (the REQ-028 per-viewport freeze
  set), and a **VP Color** column (color picker) that sets a **per-viewport color override**
  for the row's layer; both are editable only when a current viewport exists. The standalone
  "Frozen Layers" panel is **removed**. (b) **VPFREEZE / VPTHAW commands** — `VPFREEZE`
  prompts "Select objects" and freezes each picked entity's layer in the current viewport;
  `VPTHAW` is the inverse (thaws the picked layers). Esc or an empty selection changes nothing.
  A **VP Color override** recolors that layer's entities **only within its viewport** — on
  screen and in the **PDF plot** (this amends the ADR-007 monochrome-vector plot for
  per-viewport layer color; layers with no override keep the existing rendering). Because the
  on-screen viewport currently draws model linework in a fixed color (the GL true-color pass is
  deferred), the override colors **only the overridden layers**; general true-color viewport
  rendering is out of scope. All per-viewport freeze and color state is **strictly per
  viewport** — model space and other viewports are unaffected — and **persists per viewport in
  the native `.gs`** (extends REQ-031, the `frozenLayers` pattern; missing/garbage → empty, no
  crash). DXF persistence of per-viewport overrides stays deferred.
- Acceptance:
  - the standalone "Frozen Layers" panel no longer appears;
  - with a current viewport, the Layer Manager shows the **VP Freeze** and **VP Color** columns;
    with no current viewport, they are disabled;
  - checking **VP Freeze** for a layer hides that layer's geometry in the current viewport only
    (still visible in other viewports and in model space); unchecking restores it (REQ-028);
  - setting **VP Color** for a layer renders that layer's entities in the override color within
    the current viewport only; clearing the override reverts to the normal color;
  - **VPFREEZE** → select objects → those entities' layers are frozen in the current viewport
    only; **VPTHAW** → select objects → those layers are thawed; Esc / empty pick changes nothing;
  - a `.gs` save/load round-trips per-viewport frozen layers **and** color overrides;
  - a PDF plot of a viewport shows frozen layers **absent** and VP-Color layers in their
    **override color**, matching the screen;
  - existing global layer freeze/color and model-space rendering are unchanged.
- Owner-layer: UI / Commands / Domain / Renderer / IO
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-07-13 — initial (ADR-021; amends ADR-007 for per-viewport plot color;
  supersedes the REQ-028 "Frozen Layers" panel UI).

### REQ-047 — ORTHO mode: optional H/V drawing constraint, off by default, reliably toggleable
- Purpose: draw commands must be able to place points at any angle — the user could only draw
  orthogonal lines because ORTHO was forced on and could not be reliably turned off
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: **ORTHO** is an optional drawing constraint that, when **on**, snaps a draft/committed
  point onto the horizontal or vertical line through the current anchor (whichever axis the cursor is
  farther along), matching AutoCAD. ORTHO is **off by default** — with ORTHO off, LINE and the other
  draft commands commit to the **actual** cursor/typed point at **any angle**. ORTHO is toggled by
  **F8** and by the status-bar **ORTHO** button; **F8 works even while the command bar has keyboard
  focus** (it is a mode key, not text). **Object snap overrides ORTHO** (a snapped point wins). This is
  a UI/interaction constraint over the existing draw path; it changes no geometry, coordinate, or
  storage behavior (REQ-101 fidelity untouched). (The same mode-key rule applies to **F3** object-snap.)
- Acceptance:
  - a fresh drawing has ORTHO **off**; drawing a LINE between two non-aligned points produces a segment
    at the true angle (not snapped to H/V);
  - turning ORTHO **on** (F8 or the status button) constrains the next LINE segment to horizontal or
    vertical from the anchor; turning it off again restores free-angle drawing;
  - **F8 toggles ORTHO even while the command bar is focused** (typing a command does not disable F8);
  - when a point is object-snapped, ORTHO does not override the snap.
- ORTHO also governs **direct-distance entry** and **grip editing**:
  - **Direct-distance entry.** With ORTHO on and a draft anchor set, typing a bare distance places the
    next point that far from the anchor **along the axis the crosshair indicates** — left, right, up or
    down. The direction comes from the crosshair, so the anchor and the crosshair must be compared in the
    **same coordinate frame**: storage is local (world = local + document origin), so a world-space
    crosshair is converted to local first.
  - **Grip editing.** Dragging a grip is a draw operation and obeys ORTHO the same way: the dragged point
    is constrained to the horizontal or vertical line through **the grip's position when it was armed**,
    an object snap still wins, and typing a bare distance places the grip that far along that axis and
    ends the stretch (AutoCAD's grip behaviour). One undo returns the entity to its pre-drag state
    whether it was placed by dragging or by typing. While a grip is armed the **cursor dynamic-input box**
    (REQ-024) is shown even though no command is active: it displays the **live stretch distance**,
    following the cursor and updating as the grip moves, with its text **selected** so a keystroke replaces
    it. Enter commits the shown or typed distance.
- Acceptance (direct-distance and grips):
  - with ORTHO on, a first LINE point placed and the crosshair held to the **left** of it, typing `50`
    draws a 50-unit segment to the **left** — and likewise right, up and down;
  - the same holds on a drawing whose document origin is a state-plane coordinate, not only on a fresh
    drawing at the origin;
  - with ORTHO on, dragging a line's endpoint grip moves it only horizontally or vertically from where
    the grip started; turning ORTHO off restores free dragging;
  - with a grip armed, the dynamic-input box appears at the cursor showing the live distance with its text
    selected; typing `25` replaces it, moves the grip 25 units along the crosshair's axis and completes
    the stretch; one undo restores the original geometry; Esc cancels the drag with the box focused.
- Owner-layer: UI (default + key/status toggles, the grip drag) / Commands (the pure ORTHO constraint and
  axis-direction helpers, the typed-distance paths)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-07-13 — initial. Root cause: ORTHO defaulted on (`main.cpp` orthoEnabled=true) and
  F8 was gated behind text-input focus, so it could not be reliably turned off.
  2026-08-11 — extended to direct-distance entry and grip editing. Two defects fixed: (a) the LINE and
  POLYLINE typed-distance paths compared a **world**-space crosshair against a **local** anchor, so any
  drawing with a non-zero document origin had the origin added to dx alone and every typed distance drew
  to the **right**; (b) grip dragging ignored ORTHO entirely and had no typed-distance entry.

### REQ-048 — True entity/layer colors in paper space (on screen and in the plot)
- Purpose: paper space should show a drawing in its real colors like model space and AutoCAD — the
  user could only see a flat neutral color (color appeared only for REQ-046 VP Color overrides)
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: In a paper layout, both **model geometry shown through viewports** (every viewport,
  always — including the floating viewport) and **native paper-space sheet geometry** (lines, text,
  circles, arcs, ellipses, polylines, filled regions) render in their **true color** — the entity's
  own color, or its layer's color when the entity is ByLayer — resolved by the existing
  `ResolveEntityRgbaForViewport` path, instead of the flat neutral `kVpModelCol` / `kPaperGeomCol`.
  Precedence: a REQ-046 **VP Color override** wins over the entity/layer color; **selection and hover
  highlight** colors still win over the base color; per-viewport **frozen** layers (REQ-028) and
  **off / non-plottable** layers remain hidden/excluded (only color resolution changes, not
  visibility). Colors are resolved at **render and plot time** from existing attributes — no geometry,
  coordinate, or storage change (REQ-101 untouched). The **PDF plot** prints these true colors
  (**amends ADR-007**: the plot is full-color, not monochrome; the REQ-046 per-color path grouping is
  the mechanism). Delivered incrementally: (A) on-screen colors — viewport model + native sheet;
  (B) plot colors for model-through-viewport geometry; (C) plot colors for native sheet geometry
  (depends on REQ-049 adding sheet geometry to the plot).
- Acceptance:
  - model geometry in every viewport shows its true entity/layer color on screen; a VP Color override
    still wins; selected/hovered objects still show the selection/hover color;
  - native sheet geometry shows its true entity/layer color on screen;
  - the PDF plot prints model-through-viewport geometry (and, with REQ-049, native sheet geometry) in
    true colors, VP Color override still winning;
  - per-viewport frozen and off/non-plottable layers remain hidden/excluded exactly as before;
  - stored geometry/coordinates are unchanged and model-space rendering is unchanged.
- Owner-layer: UI / Renderer / IO
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-07-13 — initial (ASSUMPTION-1 follow-up from REQ-046; amends ADR-007 to full color).
  2026-07-13 — **background-adaptive white/black** (AutoCAD color-7 behavior): a resolved color that is
  near-white renders **black** on a light background (the paper sheet / plot page), and a near-black
  color renders **white** on a dark background, so linework and text stay legible. This adaptation
  applies to the paper-space resolve sites (model-through-viewport, native sheet geometry, native sheet
  text) on screen and in the plot; other colors are unchanged. Acceptance: with a layer/entity/VP-Color
  set to white, its geometry and text are **visible (black)** on the white sheet and in the plotted PDF;
  non-white colors are unaffected.

### REQ-049 — Plot native paper-space sheet geometry and text
- Purpose: title blocks and sheet annotations must appear in the plotted PDF — today the plot renders
  only model-through-viewport stroked geometry, so native sheet lines/text and all text are omitted
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: The PDF plot renders **native paper-space sheet geometry** (lines, circles, arcs,
  ellipses, polylines, filled regions — already in paper inches) and **text** (single-line TEXT and
  MTEXT), so sheets plot as composed. **Stroke (SHX) fonts** plot as their actual stroke geometry (the
  same strokes drawn on screen), which is faithful and reuses the existing SHX renderer; **TTF text**
  is plotted best-effort (approach chosen during implementation; if faithful TTF outline emission is
  not tractable in this increment it is documented as debt, not silently dropped — REQ-201). Plotted
  sheet geometry and text honor layer on/frozen/plottable state and are colored per REQ-048.
- Acceptance:
  - a layout with native sheet lines/geometry plots them at their sheet position;
  - single-line TEXT and SHX MTEXT on the sheet appear in the plot at the correct position/size;
  - plotted sheet geometry/text is colored per REQ-048 and excluded when its layer is off/non-plottable;
  - any TTF-text limitation is recorded as documented technical debt, not a silent omission.
- Owner-layer: IO / Renderer
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-07-13 — initial (enables REQ-048 increment C; PDF text rendering is a new capability).
    2026-07-15 — TTF-text debt resolved: TrueType sheet text is now plotted by embedding the real font
    (Windows Fonts-dir resolution → `FPDFText_LoadFont` → real PDF text objects, sized/positioned/colored
    per REQ-048), degrading to a base-14 standard font (logged, REQ-201) when the font file can't be
    resolved. `.ttc` collections and filled regions (ADR-011) remain the only recorded plot-text/geometry gaps.

---

### REQ-050 — MTEXT is sized by the viewport scale (constant plotted height per viewport)
- Purpose: MTEXT is a plotted annotation — its size on the final sheet must be governed by the scale of
  the viewport it is shown through, not by a single drawing-wide scale, so the same MTEXT reads at its
  intended plotted height through viewports at different scales
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A plain MTEXT entity stores a **plotted height (inches)**; its **model (world) height is
  derived at render time from the scale of the viewport it is drawn through** — the viewport being edited
  in place (floating model space) when one is active, otherwise the drawing's model plot scale
  (`modelUnitsPerPlottedInch`). Consequently the MTEXT's **plotted height stays constant on the sheet**
  regardless of that viewport's scale, and (like any model entity) it still scales on screen with zoom.
  Single-line **TEXT keeps the drawing plot scale** (plotted-inch × `modelUnitsPerPlottedInch`) — a
  specified plotted text height — and is unchanged. **Survey-point label MTEXT is unchanged** (its own
  layout owns its size, and it keeps its readability floor). No stored coordinates or heights change.
- Acceptance:
  - editing model MTEXT through a viewport whose scale differs from the drawing plot scale sizes the MTEXT
    off the viewport's scale (constant plotted height), not the drawing scale;
  - in the plain model view (no active viewport) MTEXT is sized off the drawing plot scale, unchanged;
  - single-line TEXT sizing is unchanged; survey-point labels are unchanged.
- Owner-layer: Renderer (viewport MTEXT sizing)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-07-29 — initial. On-screen viewport render only; matching the PDF plot's MTEXT sizing to
  the per-viewport scale is a noted consistency follow-up if the two diverge.

---

### REQ-051 — MTEXT edits through an AutoCAD-style "Text Formatting" panel
- Purpose: the MTEXT editor should read and behave like AutoCAD's/nanoCAD's — a floating "Text
  Formatting" toolbar with the style, font, height, and colour controls where a surveyor reaches
  for them, over an in-place editing box — instead of a bare multiline box whose only formatting
  affordance is hand-typed rich-text tags (the user asked for this redesign from a reference
  screenshot)
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Editing an MTEXT in place (REQ-039's shared editor — **model** MTEXT, including the MTEXT
  placement command's text entry, and **native paper-space** MTEXT) presents a **floating panel titled
  "Text Formatting"**, **draggable** by its title bar, with its on-screen position and its ruler/expanded
  state **persisted** across edits and sessions (UserPrefs, the REQ-040 `cmdBar*` pattern — no new global).
  The panel carries **two toolbar rows** laid out in the reference order: row 1 = text style, font,
  annotative, height, bold, italic, strikethrough, underline, overline, background mask, undo, redo,
  stacking, entity colour, ruler toggle, **OK**, and an **expand control** that collapses row 2; row 2 =
  columns, MTEXT justification, paragraph, five paragraph-alignment buttons, line spacing, lists, insert
  field, uppercase, lowercase, superscript, subscript, symbol, oblique, tracking, width factor.
  The panel **sizes itself to its content**: every control is reachable without scrolling the panel.
  A **column ruler** sits above the in-place box; the ruler toggle shows and hides it, and its **right
  marker drags to set the MTEXT's column width** (an undoable edit of the annotation's box). The
  in-place box **edits WYSIWYG** (ADR-023): text **wraps at the MTEXT's column width**, the box is **one
  line tall and grows as the text wraps** or breaks, formatting **renders as formatting** (bold, italic,
  underline, uppercase, per-run font and colour), and the `[[…]]` wire tags are **never shown**. The box
  shows **no corner resize handle**: dragging the box corner is not implemented, and an affordance that
  invites a drag it cannot perform would misrepresent the editor.
  **Controls that the stored text model already supports are functional**: text style (applies per
  REQ-044/ADR-020), **font per selected characters**, **colour per selected characters**, bold, italic,
  underline, uppercase, symbol insertion, MTEXT justification (the 9-way attachment point), and —
  **whole-object** — text height, oblique angle, and entity colour. **Every remaining control is present
  but disabled and names itself in a tooltip**; each is a separate follow-up requirement, so the panel
  never implies a capability the drawing cannot store.
  **Single-line TEXT keeps its existing bare in-place box** (AutoCAD-faithful — no toolbar). The
  **rich-text wire format and every stored `CadAnnotation` field are unchanged**, so `.gs`, DXF, and PDF
  round-trips of MTEXT behave exactly as before.
- Acceptance:
  - double-clicking a model MTEXT opens a panel titled "Text Formatting" with two toolbar rows and a
    ruler above the in-place box;
  - dragging the panel by its title bar moves it, and it reopens at that position on a later edit and
    after an application restart;
  - selecting part of the text and choosing a font changes **only** those characters, the rest keeping
    theirs; the same holds for the per-selection colour control;
  - changing height changes the whole MTEXT's plotted height; changing oblique slants the whole MTEXT;
    the entity-colour control changes the object's colour (ByLayer honoured);
  - the text-style dropdown lists the drawing's styles and applying one re-bakes the MTEXT per REQ-044;
  - bold/italic/underline/uppercase and symbol insertion behave as they did before the redesign;
  - the justification dropdown sets the MTEXT attachment point and the text re-lays out in its box;
  - every disabled control does nothing and shows a tooltip naming it; the ruler toggle hides and
    shows the ruler; the expand control collapses and restores row 2;
  - paper-space MTEXT opens the same panel; **single-line TEXT still opens the bare in-place box**;
  - OK commits and Esc cancels as before, and a `.gs` save/reload plus a DXF export of edited MTEXT are
    unchanged.
- Owner-layer: UI (panel + in-place editor) / IO (UserPrefs persistence)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-07-30 — initial. Scope deliberately bounded to controls the existing rich-text wire
  format and `CadAnnotation` already support, so no data-format change is implied; the disabled controls
  (paragraph properties, columns, fields, stacking, super/subscript, tracking, width factor, annotative,
  background mask, strikethrough, overline, in-panel undo/redo) and a drag-to-resize box corner are
  recorded follow-ups.
    2026-07-30 (same day, after the first user review) — the panel now sizes itself to its content
    (it clipped its second row); the ruler's width drag is **un-deferred** and implemented; the in-place
    box opens one line tall and grows per line of text. The word-wrap gap this exposed (ImGui's
    `InputTextMultiline` has none) was escalated and resolved as **ADR-023**: the box now edits WYSIWYG
    through the in-tree `ui/RichTextEdit` widget — text wraps at the column, the box grows with it, and
    the wire tags are hidden. Delivered under TASK-024.

### REQ-052 — Open and save DWG drawings
- Purpose: DWG is the format surveying clients, engineers and consultants actually exchange. A CAD
  product for survey work that can only read DXF cannot be handed a client's drawing, and the user
  has asked for DWG to eventually become GoSurvey's **native** format in place of `.gs`
  (see the open follow-ups below and `docs/dwg-plan.txt`).
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: GoSurvey **opens** a DWG drawing and **saves** one, through File menu entries that sit
  alongside the DXF entries and use the same import log. DWG is Autodesk's proprietary format and
  AC1032 (R2018) has no public specification, so this requirement is satisfied in **phases**
  (ADR-024): Phase 1 converts DWG ↔ DXF out of process using a converter already installed on the
  machine and reuses `DxfIo`; later phases replace that with an in-tree codec. Whatever the phase,
  the behaviour below holds.
  On **open**: the file's format tag is read and reported by release name; a file that is not a DWG
  is refused with that reason rather than mis-parsed; when no converter is available the failure
  states exactly what to install and how to point GoSurvey at it; and every limitation the import
  route imposes is written to the log, not left for the user to discover.
  On **save**: because Phase 1's payload is the DXF export, the save is **lossy** — it cannot carry
  block definitions, extra layouts, elevations, attributes, or the Civil 3D objects and proxies a
  client drawing contains. A save therefore **states what it will drop before writing anything**,
  and never overwrites the destination unless a good converted file exists, so a failed save cannot
  destroy the previous drawing.
- Acceptance:
  - File ▸ Import DWG opens a real R2018 drawing and its geometry appears in model space;
  - a non-DWG file, a missing file, and a machine with no converter each produce a specific, actionable
    message and leave the drawing untouched;
  - File ▸ Export DWG shows what the export drops, names the destination when it would be overwritten,
    and writes nothing if cancelled;
  - the DWG that GoSurvey writes **opens in AutoCAD with no recovery prompt** and contains the
    entities, layers and text that were exported;
  - a failed conversion leaves no temporary directories behind and does not modify the destination.
- Status: accepted
- Notes:
  2026-07-30 — Phase 1 delivered under TASK-030 (ADR-024, converter route). Verified against
  `26-084 - Master.dwg` (AC1032, Civil 3D lineage) and by writing a DWG that AutoCAD 2026 reopens.
  Building Phase 1 exposed a **pre-existing DXF conformance defect**: the TEXT emitter wrote group
  73 without the second `AcDbText` subclass marker, so AutoCAD rejected GoSurvey's DXF outright
  ("Unexpected DXF group code: 73 — drawing discarded"). Fixed in the same task; it had been
  silently breaking DXF export to AutoCAD, not only DWG.
  2026-07-30 — Phase 1b delivered under TASK-031: the DXF TEXT record layout and the DWG probe
  (version detection + converter discovery) were extracted into units the test target can link, and
  11 test cases committed over them — including the group-73 regression above. Proven by mutation
  test (re-introducing the defect fails 4 assertions) and by byte-identical export output before and
  after the refactor. Suite: 698 assertions / 109 cases. Remaining emitters are still untested
  (TASK-031 DEBT-4).
  Open follow-ups, each its own requirement: a native in-tree codec; preservation of objects
  GoSurvey does not model (the user's decision is that a save **must** preserve them, which Phase 1
  cannot do); first-class blocks; multiple layouts; elevations; and the migration of `.gs` to DWG
  as the native format. All are itemised in `docs/dwg-plan.txt`.
  2026-08-29 — **Native codec path decided: LibreDWG (REQ-170, ADR-041, D-2026-08-29-g).** Phase 1
  converter remains until REQ-170 is verified, then leaves the user-facing path. **This epic does
  not close DM-08** (unknown-object preservation / R2018 write). DWG write is R2000/R2004 only.

### REQ-053 — RECT command, and polylines survive a DXF/DWG save
- Purpose: rectangles are the most-drawn shape in survey deliverables (parcels, structures, title-block
  panels, detail frames) and the user had to draw four separate lines for each. Building it also exposed
  that **no polyline of any kind was written to DXF** — every polyline was dropped from an export in
  silence, so a rectangle would have been unshareable even once it could be drawn.
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: **RECT** (aliases `RECTANG`, `RECTANGLE`) draws an axis-aligned rectangle from **two
  opposite corners**, picked in the viewport or typed on the command line; the second corner also accepts
  `@dx,dy`, which is how a rectangle of an exact width and height is drawn. Between the corners the
  rectangle rubber-bands to the cursor. RECT is a **first-class draw command**: it has a ribbon button,
  a cursor dynamic-input prompt at each corner (REQ-024), right-click repeat, and it draws into **model,
  paper and floating-model space** like the other draw commands (REQ-036/REQ-037). ORTHO deliberately
  does **not** constrain the second corner — the shape is already axis-aligned and constraining it would
  collapse the rectangle to a line. A rectangle is stored as a **4-vertex closed polyline** — the same
  representation AutoCAD's RECTANG produces (an LWPOLYLINE) — so it is not a new entity type and it
  inherits selection, grips, snaps, MOVE/COPY/ROTATE/SCALE, `.gs` persistence and layer/colour handling
  from the existing polyline. **Every polyline, rectangle or not, is written to DXF as an `LWPOLYLINE`**
  carrying its true vertex count, its closed flag, and its layer/colour/linetype/lineweight/transparency;
  DWG save inherits this because it converts from the DXF (REQ-052). Degenerate corners (zero width or
  height) are rejected with a message rather than stored (REQ-201).
- Acceptance:
  - `RECT` + two viewport picks creates one rectangle; it selects, highlights and reports as a single
    object, not four lines;
  - the ribbon's Rectangle button starts it, each corner shows its dynamic-input prompt, and right-click
    repeat re-runs it;
  - drawing it on a paper layout puts it in that layout's paper store, not the model;
  - the second corner typed as `@100,50` produces a rectangle exactly 100 wide and 50 tall;
  - two coincident (or axis-collinear) corners are refused with a message and the command restarts;
  - the rectangle's four corners snap as endpoints, its edges as midpoints, and its interior offers a
    **geometric centre** (REQ-047's snap set);
  - exporting a drawing containing a rectangle writes an `LWPOLYLINE` with group 90 = 4, group 70 = 1,
    and four 10/20 vertex pairs; re-opening that DXF shows the rectangle;
  - the export log states how many `LWPOLYLINE`s were written (REQ-201).
- Owner-layer: Commands (the command + closed-polyline commit) / IO (`DxfIo` + the pure `DxfEntityEmit`
  record) / Viewport (rubber preview)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-11 — initial. Found while implementing: `ExportDxfFile_Impl` had no polyline branch
  at all, so this requirement also covers the export gap it uncovered.

### REQ-054 — Right-click selection menu, and Select similar matches type + layer + colour
- Purpose: on a survey plan the **layer** is the classification — parcel lines, contours, utilities and
  text all coexist as the same geometric primitive. "Select every line in the drawing" is never the
  selection a surveyor wants; "select every line on this layer, in this colour" is.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Right-clicking in the drawing **with a selection** opens the selection shortcut menu
  (MOVE/COPY/ROTATE/SCALE/DELETE, Select similar, Selection…, Clear selection) — this is the shipped
  AutoCAD default for Right-Click Customization's *Edit Mode*, and it remains user-configurable in
  Settings. **Select similar** replaces the selection with every object that matches the lead object on
  **all three** of: object type (annotations narrow further by annotation kind — TEXT is not similar to a
  dimension), **layer**, and **colour**. Layer and colour compare case-insensitively, an unset layer means
  layer `0` and an unset colour means `ByLayer`, so entities differing only in spelling still match. The
  command reports the count together with the layer and colour it matched on (REQ-201).
- Acceptance:
  - right-clicking with objects selected opens the shortcut menu rather than repeating the last command,
    on an existing profile as well as a fresh one;
  - with one line on layer `PARCEL` selected, Select similar picks up the other `PARCEL` lines and leaves
    lines on other layers, and lines of a different colour, unselected;
  - selecting a TEXT and running it does not sweep in dimensions;
  - the command line states the count, the layer and the colour.
- Owner-layer: Commands (`SelectSimilarToCurrentSelection`) / UI (the shortcut menu) / IO (the preference
  default and its one-time migration)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-11 — initial. Recorded as a SPEC GAP: Select similar and the right-click menu were
  already implemented with no governing requirement, and Select similar matched on object type alone.
  The menu was also unreachable, because `rightClickEditMode` shipped defaulted to RepeatLastCommand.

### REQ-055 — A newly opened drawing is the focused tab, and a drawing reopens at the view it was saved at
- Purpose: two interruptions to the basic open/save loop. Creating or opening a drawing left the user on
  the *previous* tab, so every File > New and File > Open needed a manual tab click to reach the drawing
  just asked for. And a saved drawing reopened at the default view rather than where the user left it,
  so every reopen started with a zoom/pan hunt to get back to the work.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: **Tab focus.** Creating a drawing (File > New, the tab bar's "+") or opening one
  (File > Open) makes that drawing's tab the **active, focused** tab in the same action — no second click.
  Closing a tab likewise focuses the tab that takes its place.
  **Saved view.** Saving a drawing records the drawing viewport's **pan and zoom**, and opening it restores
  them, so the drawing reopens looking at what the user left on screen. The pan is stored in **world**
  coordinates: loading may rebase the document origin (large-coordinate rebase), and a local pan would
  silently point somewhere else in the drawing after that. The saved view is an **additive** `.gs` key —
  older files still load, and fall back to framing the drawing.
- Acceptance:
  - File > New shows the new empty drawing immediately, with its tab selected;
  - File > Open shows the opened drawing immediately, with its tab selected, with two or more tabs open;
  - pan and zoom somewhere specific, save, close, reopen — the drawing is at that same pan and zoom;
  - the same holds for a drawing on state-plane coordinates, where opening rebases the document origin;
  - a `.gs` saved before this requirement still opens, framed to its drawing rather than at a stale view.
- Owner-layer: UI (tab bar selection) / IO (`GsIo` view key)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-11 — initial. Root causes: the tab loop assigned `activeDrawingIdx` and consumed
  `pendingDrawingTabSwitch` from whichever tab ImGui reported selected, and tabs are submitted in index
  order — so the still-selected old tab always won before the new tab was reached. The `.gs` writer had
  no view state at all.

### REQ-056 — TRIM defaults to smart line trim, controlled by the TRIMSTATE system variable
- Purpose: the common trim is "get rid of that bit" — the user knows what should go, not which object is
  doing the cutting. Making cutting-edge selection mandatory put a bookkeeping step in front of every
  trim. The drawn-line trim was already implemented but hidden behind an `L` option nobody would find.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: **TRIM** starts in the mode named by the **TRIMSTATE** system variable:
  - **TRIMSTATE 0 (default)** — *smart trim*: two clicks draw a line across the drawing, and the pieces
    that line crosses are trimmed. No cutting edges are picked.
  - **TRIMSTATE 1** — *classic*: pick cutting edges, Enter, then click the pieces to trim.
  Within a run, **T** switches to picking cutting edges and **L** back to the drawn line, so either mode
  stays reachable whatever TRIMSTATE is set to. `TRIMSTATE` typed bare prompts
  `Enter new value for TRIMSTATE <n>:` and a blank Enter keeps the current value; `TRIMSTATE 1` sets it in
  one line. Only 0 and 1 are accepted — anything else is refused with a message (REQ-201). The value
  **persists in user preferences**, so it is a setting rather than a per-session mode.
  While picking cutting edges (and trim targets), entity picking uses the **existing hover highlight and
  selection highlight**: the object under the cursor pre-highlights, and picked cutting edges stay
  highlighted as a selection. TRIM is the only command that relaxes the "no entity hover during a
  command" rule, because its clicks name objects rather than coordinates.
- Acceptance:
  - on a fresh profile, TRIM prompts for the first point of a trim line — no cutting-edge step;
  - two clicks across a segment trim it, and the command ends;
  - `TRIMSTATE 1` then TRIM prompts for cutting edges; the mode survives a restart;
  - a bare `TRIMSTATE` shows the current value and blank Enter leaves it unchanged; `TRIMSTATE 2` is
    refused with a message and the value is unchanged;
  - `T` during a line trim switches to cutting edges, `L` during edge picking switches back;
  - hovering an object while picking cutting edges highlights it; picked edges stay highlighted; hovering
    an already-picked edge does not double-highlight.
- Owner-layer: Commands (mode + the TRIMSTATE command) / UI (hover gate) / Viewport (highlight) /
  IO (preference persistence)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-11 — initial. The drawn-line trim already existed as the `L` option; this makes it
  the default and gives the choice a name.

### REQ-302 — Tabbed, responsive application ribbon (GitHub issue #83)
- Purpose: `DrawRibbonBar` (`CadUi.cpp:2363`) lays every section — Edit, Draw, Modify, Annotate,
  Inquiry, Survey, View, plus the contextual Layout/PDF Underlay/Hatch sections — out in a single
  horizontal row inside a child window opened with `ImGuiWindowFlags_HorizontalScrollbar`
  (`CadUi.cpp:2429-2430`). At anything narrower than a wide desktop window this scrolls, hiding
  tools behind a scrollbar the user must know to operate. The ribbon should instead read as a
  native CAD ribbon (tabbed, like AutoCAD/Civil 3D/nanoCAD) and never require scrolling.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: The ribbon gains a top-level tab strip (Home, Insert, Annotate, View, Manage, Output,
  Survey — only the active tab's sections render) and a responsive layout that adapts to available
  window width without ever falling back to a scrollbar. Delivered incrementally — each increment
  independently shippable and independently verifiable, the same pattern REQ-103/REQ-070 used:
  1. **Tab infrastructure** — the tab strip, persisted active tab, and re-homing of every *existing*
     ribbon section under the tab that owns it. No command's behavior, availability, or contextual
     trigger changes — only where it is found. This closes the "no tab structure" and "organization"
     acceptance groups of issue #83 for the sections that exist today; it does **not** yet remove the
     scrollbar at narrow widths (that is increment 2) and does not yet give Insert/Manage/Output real
     content (that is increment 3, since no ribbon commands for those categories exist yet — see
     Acceptance below).
  2. **Responsive layout engine** — wide/medium/narrow breakpoints per tab (reduced spacing/padding,
     compact icon-only buttons, row reflow, an overflow menu for a group that still doesn't fit).
     Removes `ImGuiWindowFlags_HorizontalScrollbar` entirely. Likely warrants its own ADR before
     implementation, since it is a genuinely new, reusable UI abstraction (one responsive-layout
     mechanism used by all 7 tabs) — to be scoped when this increment opens.
  3. **Content audit** — Insert/Manage/Output get real command sets by relocating existing
     menu-bar-only commands (import, plot/export/publish, settings/standards) into their tabs;
     full audit of every ribbon command against its assigned tab/group, no duplicate or unclear
     placement.
- Acceptance — Increment 1, Tab infrastructure (this increment):
  - a tab strip renders at the top of the ribbon band, above the existing panel/section row, with
    exactly 7 tabs in this order: Home, Insert, Annotate, View, Manage, Output, Survey;
  - the tab strip reuses the existing Model/Layout tab toggle styling
    (`PushModeToggleButtonColors`/`PopModeToggleButtonColors`, `CadUi.cpp:6308-6313`, REQ-025/026
    precedent) rather than inventing a new tab-button style — the active tab is visually distinct
    the same way the active space tab already is;
  - clicking a tab sets `cmd.activeRibbonTab` and only that tab's re-homed sections render below it;
    a tab with no sections assigned yet (Insert, Manage, Output — see mapping below) shows an empty
    panel row, not an error or placeholder text;
  - the active tab persists across restart: `activeRibbonTab` is a plain `AppCommandState` field,
    loaded/saved in `UserPrefs.cpp` with the same one-line shape as `trimState`
    (`UserPrefs.cpp:166-167,387`) — app-level, not per-drawing (D-2026-08-24-g precedent). A fresh
    profile defaults to Home;
  - switching tabs never touches `cmd.active` (an in-progress command), the current selection, the
    undo stack, or drawing geometry — starting a command or making a selection, switching tabs, then
    switching back leaves the command still active and the selection still intact;
  - **section-to-tab mapping** (amended 2026-08-25, D-2026-08-25-d, from the user's own GUI-pass
    feedback — every section otherwise keeps its existing content, condition, and command wiring
    unchanged, this increment only changes which tab shows it):
    - Home: Edit (Undo/Redo/Copy/Paste), then Draw+Modify (model space) or Layout (paper space,
      `ribbonPaperSpace` — unchanged trigger)
    - Annotate: **Text** section (Text/Mtext + style dropdown — the section formerly labeled
      "Annotate", renamed) and **Dimensions** section (Aligned/Linear, moved here from Survey's
      Inquiry section) — model space only, matching today (both sections are nested inside the same
      `if (!ribbonPaperSpace)` block Draw/Modify already used and stay that way)
    - View: View (Extents/Window + visual-style combo)
    - Survey: Inquiry (ID Point + Elev/Grade only — Aligned/Linear moved to Annotate's Dimensions
      section above), Survey — model space only, same existing nesting as Annotate
    - Insert, Manage, Output: no section maps here yet (empty tab) — populated in increment 3
  - **the right-hand current-layer strip (`RibbonLayerStrip`) and every contextual section keep
    today's trigger conditions and render on every tab, unchanged** — Layers (always), Layout
    (paper space, gated on `ribbonPaperSpace`, itself folded into the Home-tab condition above since
    it already lived in that same `if`/`else`), PDF Underlay (a `PdfUnderlay` selected), Hatch (hatch
    command active or a `FilledRegion` selected). Scoping Layers/PDF/Hatch to a single tab would
    hide them whenever a different tab happens to be active while the user is mid-edit on that
    object, a real usability regression this increment deliberately avoids; revisiting whether they
    should instead force-select their owning tab is left to increment 3;
  - the ribbon's total height grows by exactly the tab strip's height plus its gap row (the existing
    `139.f` constant in `main.cpp:405` becomes `139.f + kRibbonTabStripH + kRibbonTabStripGapY`) —
    panel content height inside each section is unchanged, so no existing section's button sizing
    regresses;
  - **no ribbon scrollbar at the window sizes exercised in the user's GUI pass** (amended
    2026-08-25, D-2026-08-25-d): `RibbonToolsLeft` is sized to the ACTIVE tab's own precomputed
    content width, not a blanket "window width minus the 500px layer strip" cap, with
    `ImGuiWindowFlags_HorizontalScrollbar` replaced by `NoScrollbar`/`NoScrollWithMouse`. This is a
    **partial, disclosed** answer to "no scrollbars anywhere" — a tab whose content is wider than the
    actual app window still clips rather than scrolling; the full guarantee across all window widths
    (compact buttons, row-wrap/overflow) is increment 2's job, not this one's;
  - build is clean; the full regression suite stays green; a manual GUI pass confirms tab switching,
    persistence across restart, and that every command reachable today (by ribbon) is still
    reachable today, now under its mapped tab.
- Acceptance — Increment 2, Responsive layout engine (opened 2026-08-25, D-2026-08-25-e, ADR-038):
  - a `RibbonBreakpoint` (Wide/Medium/Narrow) is computed per active tab, per frame, from available
    width vs. that tab's own `wideW`/`mediumW` (ADR-038 (a)) — no persisted state, no user-facing
    setting;
  - Wide renders byte-for-byte as increment 1 does today — no regression to any existing section's
    button size, spacing, or label;
  - Medium renders every section from the active tab with compact metrics (smaller button width,
    icon-only small buttons, tighter spacing) — same sections, same commands, no section dropped;
  - Narrow renders sections left-to-right at Medium metrics until the next section would not fit,
    then collapses everything remaining for that tab into one "More ▼" button whose popup renders
    the overflowed sections' full Wide-metric content unchanged (ADR-038 (b)) — every command
    reachable today stays reachable at every width, none hidden or removed;
  - `RibbonToolsLeft` is sized to `min(fittedW, available)` — never wider than the actual available
    width, so no ribbon control is ever clipped, at any tested window width;
  - no horizontal or vertical scrollbar anywhere in the ribbon at any tested window width (this is
    the full guarantee increment 1 explicitly left partial);
  - switching breakpoints (by resizing the window) never touches `cmd.active`, selection, undo
    stack, or drawing geometry — same invariant increment 1's tab switching already holds;
  - build is clean; the full regression suite stays green; a manual GUI pass at multiple window
    widths (including at least 2 narrower than any width increment 1 was tested at) confirms Wide/
    Medium/Narrow read correctly on screen, the "More" popup opens and every command in it works,
    and no scrollbar or clipping appears at any tested width.
- Acceptance — Increment 3, Content audit (opened 2026-08-25, D-2026-08-25-h):
  - **Correction to this requirement's own Statement, found while opening this increment:** the
    "relocating existing menu-bar-only commands (import, plot/export/publish, settings/standards)"
    language above was written before the codebase was checked against it. `DrawMainMenuBar`
    (`CadUi.cpp:1181-1347`) is File/Edit/View only — 168 lines total. There is no Blocks/INSERT
    mechanism (REQ-107, status `proposed`, not built), no Xref, no image attach, no point-cloud
    import, and no Publish/Standards/Purge/Audit/Units command anywhere in the codebase (confirmed
    by grep across `src/`). The only genuine relocation candidates that exist today are: Import
    DXF, Import DWG (File menu), Export DXF, Export DWG (File menu), and Settings (View menu) —
    Plot and Batch Plot already have a ribbon home (Home tab, paper space, from increment 1).
    Increment 3 relocates exactly these; it does not invent Blocks/Xref/point-cloud/Publish/
    Standards content, since none of that exists to relocate — building any of it is out of scope
    (REQ-107 or a future requirement, not this one).
  - Insert tab gets one "Import" section: Import DXF, Import DWG (DWG gated on
    `FindDwgConverter().available()`, identical tooltip/disabled behavior to the existing File-menu
    item) — same underlying `ImportDxfFile`/`ImportDwgFile` calls, no new import logic;
  - View tab gets a new "Settings" section (user's explicit placement decision, 2026-08-25 —
    overrides this requirement's original Manage-tab assumption): one button opens the same
    Settings window `cmd.showSettingsWindow = true` already opens from the View menu;
  - Output tab gets two sections: "Export" (Export DXF, Export DWG, same DWG gating/behavior as the
    File menu) and "Plot" (Plot, Batch Plot) — Plot/Batch Plot **move** from Home tab's paper-space
    Layout section to Output (user's explicit decision, 2026-08-25) rather than appearing in both
    places, per issue #83's "avoid duplicate or unclear placement of commands"; Home tab's Layout
    section keeps only Rect VP / Poly VP (viewport-authoring tools, not output);
  - Manage tab is **not** populated in this increment — the only candidate found (Settings) was
    placed on View instead per the user's decision above, and nothing else exists to relocate
    there today; it stays an empty panel row, same as it's been since increment 1, until a future
    requirement gives it real content;
  - File/Edit/View menu items are unchanged — Import/Export/Settings remain reachable from the menu
    bar too; this is a second entry point, not a move, matching increment 1's own precedent (Edit
    menu's Copy/Paste/Undo/Redo already duplicate the Home tab's Edit section);
  - no command's underlying behavior changes — only where each is reachable from the ribbon;
  - switching to Insert/View/Output tabs never touches `cmd.active`, selection, undo stack, or
    drawing geometry, same invariant every earlier increment holds;
  - build is clean; the full regression suite stays green; a manual GUI pass confirms Import DXF/
    DWG, Settings, Export DXF/DWG, and Plot/Batch Plot all work correctly from their new ribbon
    locations, Home's paper-space Layout section still renders correctly with only Rect VP/Poly VP,
    and no scrollbar/clipping is introduced at any width already covered by increment 2.
- Owner-layer: UI (`src/ui/CadUi.cpp`, `src/ui/CadUiSettings.cpp`) / IO (`src/io/UserPrefs.cpp`,
  preference persistence)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-25 — initial (GitHub issue #83, D-2026-08-25-c). Sequenced into 3 increments;
  increment 1's acceptance fully specified, increments 2-3 deferred until reached (REQ-103 precedent).
  2026-08-25 (D-2026-08-25-d) — amended from the user's own manual GUI pass: tab-strip padding, the
  View tab's visual-style combo width, the section-to-tab mapping (Dimensions/Text split under
  Annotate), and the scrollbar-removal mechanism (content-sized `RibbonToolsLeft`, partial —
  see Acceptance above).
  2026-08-25 (D-2026-08-25-e) — increment 2 opened: Acceptance written above, ADR-038 recorded
  (measure-then-decide breakpoints + shared overflow popup); increment 3 remains deferred.
  2026-08-25 (D-2026-08-25-g) — increment 2 done: user confirmed the manual GUI pass, no findings.
  2026-08-25 (D-2026-08-25-h) — increment 3 opened: this requirement's own Statement corrected
  (no blocks/xrefs/point clouds/standards exist to relocate — see Acceptance above); Acceptance
  written from what actually exists plus the user's explicit placement decisions (Settings → View,
  not Manage; Plot/Batch Plot → Output, moved off Home, not duplicated).
  2026-08-25 (D-2026-08-25-i) — increment 3 done, user confirmed with no findings; REQ-302 fully
  delivered, all 3 increments complete, issue #83 closed.

### REQ-303 — POLYLINE finishes without typing CLOSE or END (GitHub issue #80)
- **Duplication note (found merging `master` into `beta` for REQ-304/issue #82, D-2026-08-25-l):**
  `origin/beta` independently implemented this exact same GitHub issue (#80) as **REQ-118** (below,
  `spec/requirements.md`), in a separate, parallel session — same feature, same acceptance intent,
  different task number (TASK-109 on beta vs. TASK-108 here) and a real, small implementation
  difference: beta's blank-Enter handler explicitly clears an active bearing lock
  (`CancelSegmentAnglePick`/`ResetSegmentAngleLock`) before committing, which this requirement's own
  implementation did not. The merge kept **this** requirement's structure and specific refusal
  message (matching this requirement's own tested Acceptance text below) and folded in beta's extra
  state-cleanup call as a correctness improvement — see D-2026-08-25-l for the full reconciliation.
  Both REQ-118 and REQ-303 are left `accepted` as an honest historical record of the duplicate work;
  neither describes the merged implementation's exact code in full, cosmetic (message-text/
  comment) detail any more, only in substance.
- Purpose: POLYLINE currently requires the user to type `CLOSE`/`CL` or `END` to finish, which is
  not how the rest of the application's drawing commands read — LINE already finishes segments with
  a bare Enter, and every CAD application the user is used to closes a polygon by clicking back on
  its own start point. The typed keywords stay (nothing here removes them); this adds the two
  interactions a CAD-native user reaches for first.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: while POLYLINE (or 3DPOLY, which shares the same state machine — `polylineDraft3d` only
  changes the vertex label and Z handling) is actively drawing (`polylinePhase == NeedNextPoint`):
  (a) the draft's own start vertex is offered as an ordinary Endpoint object snap — same glyph,
  priority, and OSNAP-Endpoint toggle as any other endpoint, not a new snap kind — and a viewport
  click that lands on it closes the polyline exactly as typed `CLOSE` does, including `CLOSE`'s own
  minimum-vertex refusal when attempted too early; (b) a blank Enter (an empty command-line submit)
  finishes the polyline OPEN exactly as typed `END` does, including `END`'s own minimum-segment
  refusal when attempted too early, and — unlike LINE's own blank-Enter, which restarts a new
  chain — exits the command, matching what `END` already does. Both interactions call the same
  `CommitPolylineDraft` the typed keywords call, so the paper-space parity TASK-107 (REQ-039) gave
  that function applies to both with no separate implementation.
- Acceptance:
  1. with at least two segments drawn (≥3 vertices, `CLOSE`'s existing minimum), clicking the
     viewport at the polyline's own start point closes it — same log line typed `CLOSE` produces
     ("POLYLINE closed."), and the command exits;
  2. clicking the start point with fewer than two segments refuses without closing or adding a
     vertex there, using the same messages `CLOSE` already gives at that vertex count, and the
     command stays active;
  3. with at least one segment drawn (≥2 vertices, `END`'s existing minimum), a blank Enter finishes
     the polyline open — same log line typed `END` produces ("POLYLINE complete."), and the command
     exits;
  4. a blank Enter with zero segments (only the start point placed) refuses without finishing, using
     the same message typed `END` already gives at that vertex count, and the command stays active;
  5. typed `CLOSE`/`CL` and `END` continue to work exactly as before — neither removed nor changed;
  6. a paper layout drawn onto with either interaction commits to that layout's `paperPoly*` stores,
     not the model store (REQ-039 parity, inherited from TASK-107, not reimplemented here);
  7. the start-point snap only appears while POLYLINE/3DPOLY is drawing, obeys the OSNAP-Endpoint
     toggle like every other endpoint, and disappears once the command ends.
- Owner-layer: Commands / Viewport (the snap candidate)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-25 — initial (GitHub issue #80, D-2026-08-25-j). Reusing the existing Endpoint
  snap kind (no new glyph) and treating an early click on the start point as a refusal rather than a
  silently-added vertex were both confirmed with the user ahead of implementation.

### REQ-304 — Dynamic cursor text matches the command line for every command state (GitHub issue #82)
- Purpose: LINE already shows a state-specific prompt ("Specify first point:") right next to the
  cursor, but several other commands showed nothing there — the cursor gave no indication of what
  the active command was waiting for, even though the command line (bottom bar) had a real, correct
  prompt. The issue asks for a single source of truth: whatever a command is currently expecting
  should drive both the command line and the cursor prompt identically, and the two must never
  disagree or go stale.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: **The architecture already had a single source of truth before this requirement**:
  `CommandInputHint` (`CadUi.cpp:6111`) and its per-command "FooterHint" delegates
  (`CadCommands.cpp`, declared in `CadCommands.hpp:3721-3732`) are queried fresh every frame, and
  the same return value feeds both `DrawCommandLinePanel`'s live hint line
  (`RenderClickableCommandHint(CommandInputHint(cmd), ...)`, `CadUi.cpp:7251`) and the at-cursor
  dynamic-input palette (`CadUi.cpp:12681-12693`, which shows `CadPointPromptLabel` for point
  entry and falls back to the identical `CommandInputHint` text otherwise). Recomputing from live
  state every frame — nothing is cached across states — is also what already guarantees no staleness
  and no command-line/cursor disagreement (Acceptance items 3-6 and 14-16 below were already true
  for every command that had a branch in this function at all).
  A full audit of every `AppCommandState::Kind` against that if-chain (cross-referencing the enum in
  `CadCommands.hpp:1122` against every branch in `CommandInputHint` and its delegates) found **ten
  Kind values with no branch at all**, which fell through to the generic `"Command:"` placeholder on
  both surfaces: `FeatureLine`, `Fillet`, `Chamfer`, `PdfAttach`, `Hatch`, `Pan`, `VpFreeze`,
  `VpThaw`, `Elev`, `Orbit`.
  - `Pan` and `Orbit` are **not** gaps: both are continuous camera-drag modes with a dedicated
    hand cursor and the point-entry palette deliberately suppressed for `Pan`
    (`CadUi.cpp:12878-12884`, REQ-045/REQ-084 (c)) — a changed cursor icon is the correct, existing
    contextual feedback for a drag gesture with no typed value, and adding a redundant text prompt
    on top of it would contradict that existing design. These two are explicitly out of scope.
  - The remaining eight (`FeatureLine`, `Fillet`, `Chamfer`, `PdfAttach`, `Hatch`, `VpFreeze`,
    `VpThaw`, `Elev`) are real gaps: `FILLET`/`CHAMFER` had informative text but only as one-time
    `log.push_back` scrollback lines at each state transition (`CadCommands.cpp`, `StartFilletCommand`
    / `HandleFilletViewportPick` / `HandleFilletText` and the CHAMFER equivalents) — never a
    queryable "what is the state right now" function — so the scrollback looked reasonable while the
    live command-line hint and the cursor both still showed `"Command:"`. `FeatureLine`, `PdfAttach`,
    `Hatch`, `VpFreeze`, `VpThaw`, and `Elev` had no per-state hint mechanism of any kind.
  - Fix: new branches added to the existing `DrawingExtrasFooterHint` (`CadCommands.cpp`) — the
    function whose own doc comment already states new commands should extend it rather than invent a
    separate mechanism (`CadUi.cpp:6376-6377`) — covering every reachable state of all eight commands
    (FILLET/CHAMFER: `WaitFirstEntity`/`WaitSecondEntity` plus each `*TextAwaiting*` sub-prompt for
    radius/trim/distance/angle; FEATURELINE: first point, next point, and the pending-elevation
    prompt; PDFATTACH: `WaitInsertPoint` plus the two never-reached phases `WaitScaleRef`/
    `WaitRotationPt`, kept for completeness since the enum already declares them; HATCH/ELEV/
    VPFREEZE/VPTHAW: their one real state each). No new abstraction, dependency, or query mechanism
    — the fix is closing gaps in the one that already existed.
- Acceptance (from GitHub issue #82's checklist):
  1. every command has been audited for dynamic cursor prompts — done via the `Kind`-enum
     cross-reference above;
  2. every command input state has an appropriate dynamic cursor prompt where applicable — done for
     all `Kind` values except `Pan`/`Orbit`, which use cursor-icon feedback by design (see above);
  3. dynamic cursor text reflects the current command state — true by construction (fresh function
     call every frame, no cached string);
  4. dynamic cursor text updates immediately on every state transition — same reasoning;
  5. dynamic cursor text does not become stale — same reasoning;
  6. commands that already had dynamic cursor text continue to work correctly — no existing branch
     was modified, only new branches added; full regression suite (593/593 Catch2 + headless
     transcripts) green, unchanged from before this task;
  7. commands missing dynamic cursor text are updated — `FeatureLine`, `Fillet`, `Chamfer`,
     `PdfAttach`, `Hatch`, `VpFreeze`, `VpThaw`, `Elev`;
  8-12. point / coordinate / numeric / angle-azimuth-bearing / entity-selection input all provide
     contextual cursor feedback — already true pre-existing for the commands that had it (LINE,
     ROTATE, DIMANGULAR, TRIM, OFFSET, MOVE/COPY, etc.); newly true for FILLET/CHAMFER's numeric
     radius/distance/angle sub-prompts, ELEV's numeric elevation, and the eight commands' entity-pick
     states;
  13. command variants update the dynamic cursor when selected — already true (SCALE/ROTATE
     reference-mode variants); newly true for FILLET's Radius/Trim and CHAMFER's
     Distance/Angle/Trim variants, whose hint text changes the instant the corresponding
     `*TextAwaiting*` flag flips;
  14. command cancellation removes the dynamic cursor prompt — unchanged, generic to `cmd.active`
     resetting to `Kind::None` (not touched by this task) for every command, including the eight
     fixed here;
  15. command completion removes the dynamic cursor prompt — same reasoning;
  16. the command line and dynamic cursor remain semantically consistent — guaranteed by construction
     (one function, two call sites, `CadUi.cpp:7251` and `CadUi.cpp:12681-12693`);
  17. new commands can provide dynamic cursor prompts without a separate UI system — already true
     (the extension point already existed and is exactly what this task used, not something built
     for it);
  build is clean; the full regression suite (593 Catch2 cases + headless transcripts) stays green,
  unchanged pass count from before this task. Verification for this requirement is necessarily
  manual for the visual/wording quality of the eight new hint strings (same as REQ-024's own
  "manual" verification method) — this session cannot simulate mouse hover to screenshot the cursor
  bubble (`project_gui_hover_not_automatable` precedent); the user's own GUI pass is the outstanding
  step.
- Owner-layer: Commands (`CadCommands.cpp` — `DrawingExtrasFooterHint`) / UI (consumes it unchanged,
  `CadUi.cpp`)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-25 — initial (GitHub issue #82, D-2026-08-25-k). Full `Kind`-enum audit found
  ten gaps; two (`Pan`/`Orbit`) are by-design exclusions (cursor-icon feedback), eight fixed by
  extending the existing `DrawingExtrasFooterHint` delegate. No architectural decision — the
  single-source-of-truth mechanism the issue asked for already existed; this closes coverage gaps
  in it.

### REQ-305 — ARRAY command: rectangular and polar (GitHub issue #87)
> Relabeled from `REQ-304` while merging `master` into `beta` — that number was already taken on
> `beta` by "Dynamic cursor text" (issue #82) above, a real ID collision from two independent
> sessions working the same day.
- Purpose: users need to place regular grids and circular patterns of existing drawing objects
  (survey monument symbols, culvert/utility grids, radial layouts) without manually repeating
  COPY. ARRAY generates the pattern interactively with a live preview, as a single undoable step.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: a new `ARRAY` command follows the shape of the existing MOVE/COPY/ROTATE/SCALE/MIRROR
  modify commands (`AppCommandState::Kind`, `ModifyPhase`-style sub-state, `TransformPreview`'s
  ghost-preview batch, `CommandInputHint`'s per-phase cursor/command-line prompt, one
  `PushUndoSnapshot` for the whole command). Flow: (1) select objects — reusing the existing
  modify-command selection shape (a pre-existing selection is used as-is; otherwise clicking
  individual entities and/or dragging a window/crossing box, both accumulating additively into one
  growing selection — Shift-click or a subtracting crossing box removes — confirmed by pressing
  Enter, "ESC cancels" at any point before that); (2) choose array type via the existing clickable-command-variant mechanism
  (`[R]ectangular` / `[P]olar` tokens, keyboard letter or click, both routed through the same command
  text handler); (3a) **Rectangular** — columns, column spacing, rows, row spacing, each enterable by
  typed number or by an interactive cursor-driven distance, with the grid preview updating live as
  each value changes; the original selection occupies grid cell (0,0); (3b) **Polar** — center point
  (via the normal point-input path: click, typed X,Y, object snap), number of items (**total**
  instances including the original — "8" produces 8 total, not 8 additional), angle to fill (360°
  = full circle, a partial angle = an evenly spaced arc over that sweep, following the existing
  CW-from-north angle convention), and a Rotate-items Yes/No toggle (Yes: each copy's orientation
  turns with its position, reusing `DuplicateCadSelectionRotated`'s rotation; No: each copy keeps the
  source orientation and only its reference point moves to the computed position) — defaulting to
  the same default ROTATE's own copy-mode implies (rotate = Yes), with the polar preview updating
  live as center/count/angle/rotate change. (4) Confirm commits every instance in one
  `PushUndoSnapshot`; ESC at any point before confirmation cancels with no geometry created and the
  original selection untouched. Array instances are independent duplicated entities (not a
  persistent associative array object) — reusing the existing `DuplicateCadSelection{Translated,
  Rotated}`-style per-type duplication, extended to loop per instance instead of producing one
  copy — consistent with REQ-103 MIRROR/ROTATE-copy's existing "duplicate, never mutate the
  source" shape. Path arrays and post-creation associative editing are out of scope (issue #87).
  Survey points are **excluded** from the array selection, filtered the same way `Surface` is
  already dropped from MOVE/ROTATE/SCALE (`DropSurfacesFromSelectionForTransform`'s pattern) — an
  array-sized batch of survey points cannot go through the existing single-offset ID-conflict modal
  (COPY/ROTATE-copy), and building N-way ID resolution is new scope this issue does not require
  (D-2026-08-25, confirmed with the user). Entity types the modify commands already exclude
  (Surface, Mesh, PdfUnderlay) are excluded from ARRAY for the same stated reasons.
- Acceptance:
  1. `ARRAY` is launchable by typed command and offers `[R]ectangular`/`[P]olar` as both a typed
     letter and a clickable command-line token, both invoking the same start-array-type function;
  2. object selection accepts a pre-existing selection, individual entity/annotation/fill/survey-
     point clicks, and/or a window/crossing box — any mix accumulates into one selection until
     Enter confirms it, matching MOVE/COPY/SCALE/ROTATE/MIRROR/ALIGN's own selection step
     (D-2026-08-25-n); Surface/Mesh/PdfUnderlay/survey points are dropped from the array selection
     with a log line naming the count and reason, matching the existing MIRROR/MOVE exclusion
     wording style;
  3. Rectangular: columns, column spacing, rows, row spacing are each settable by typed number or
     interactive cursor distance; confirming produces `columns × rows` total instances positioned
     on a regular grid, cell (0,0) at the original selection's position, with correct spacing along
     both axes for both positive and negative spacing (grows the opposite direction);
  4. Polar: center point accepts click, typed X,Y, and object snap; item count N produces exactly N
     total instances (the original plus N-1 new copies) evenly spaced across the fill angle;
     360° places the last instance at 360°/N before wrapping (no duplicate instance at 0°==360°);
     a partial angle (e.g. 180°) spaces N instances evenly across that arc; Rotate-items = Yes turns
     each copy's orientation with its position, Rotate-items = No keeps every copy at the source
     orientation;
  5. the preview (ghost lines/circles via `TransformPreview`, matching MOVE/COPY's existing preview
     coverage — LineSeg/Circle/Arc/Ellipse/Polyline/FeatureLine) updates immediately as any
     parameter changes and commits no geometry until confirmed;
  6. `CommandInputHint` returns an ARRAY-specific prompt for every phase (select objects, array
     type, columns, column spacing, rows, row spacing, center point, item count, angle to fill,
     rotate behavior), matching the existing per-phase-hint pattern;
  7. ESC at any phase before confirmation cancels with a log line (matching `CancelActiveCommand`'s
     existing per-command messages), discards the preview, and leaves the original geometry and
     selection unchanged — no partial array remains;
  8. confirming an array pushes exactly one undo snapshot for the whole operation; Ctrl+Z after a
     completed array removes every generated instance and leaves the source objects exactly as
     before the command; the source objects are never deleted or modified by ARRAY;
  9. every entity type MOVE/COPY can duplicate (LineSeg, Circle, Arc, Ellipse, Polyline, Annotation,
     FilledRegion, FeatureLine) is duplicated correctly by ARRAY, including types not covered by
     the live preview (Annotation, FilledRegion — consistent with MOVE/COPY's own preview gap).
- Owner-layer: Commands (`CadCommands.cpp`/`.hpp`), Viewport (`TransformPreview.cpp`, cursor hint)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-25 — initial (GitHub issue #87, D-2026-08-25-m). Survey-point exclusion from
  the array selection was confirmed with the user ahead of implementation (see Statement).
  2026-08-25 — Acceptance 2 amended (D-2026-08-25-n): the user reported ARRAY's opening
  "select objects" step only accepted a two-corner window/crossing box, with no way to click an
  individual object and no way to keep selecting after one box — a real gap against how every other
  CAD selection step in this app already behaves, not a spec-compliant report. Rather than fix ARRAY
  alone (which was accurately matching MOVE/COPY/SCALE/ROTATE/MIRROR/ALIGN's own identical
  limitation at the time), the user chose to fix the shared selection shape across all of them in
  one pass. See REQ-103's own revision note for the shared mechanism; STRETCH is deliberately
  excluded (REQ-103 step 5 — its crossing box is load-bearing geometry, not just an object filter).

### REQ-306 — Dynamic cursor input is content-driven, not a fixed footprint (GitHub issue #104)
- Purpose: the at-cursor dynamic input (REQ-024/REQ-304 — `##ViewportCommandInput` and the grip
  drag's `##ViewportGripInput`, both `CadUi.cpp`) is a small window that already reads its prompt
  and field content fresh every frame, but its input field used a **fixed-width clamp**
  (`std::clamp(240.f * scale, 160.f, 360.f)` for point entry, `360.f`/`200.f` for the single
  non-point field, `200.f`/`140.f`/`320.f` for the grip-stretch field) — a footprint sized for the
  longest string the field could ever hold, shown even when the live content is short (e.g. a
  short bearing or a two-digit distance). The issue asks for the box to size to what it is
  currently showing.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: the width of the dynamic-cursor input field — and the window that contains it — is
  computed from the field's **current text** (`ImGui::CalcTextSize`, plus fixed chrome for caret
  and frame padding) every frame, clamped only to a minimum (so an empty/one-character field stays
  clickable) and a viewport-fraction maximum (so a long paste cannot take over the screen), never
  to a constant tuned for the longest possible value. The non-point field additionally sizes to
  fit its placeholder hint ("Type value or Enter") while empty, since the hint must stay readable.
  The window itself keeps `ImGuiWindowFlags_AlwaysAutoResize` (pre-existing, REQ-024) and its
  padding is tightened from 10x8px to 8x6px (rule: remove padding that isn't earning its space).
  Positioning (offset from the cursor, clamped to the work area near screen edges) is unchanged in
  mechanism but now estimates the pre-layout window size from the same content-driven width instead
  of a constant, so the edge clamp matches the box actually drawn.
- Acceptance:
  1. the field's on-screen width tracks its own text: a one-character value (e.g. typing `5`) draws
     a visibly narrower box than a long typed expression (e.g. `1234567.891,1234567.891`), in the
     same frame the text changes;
  2. the window carries no content beyond the prompt label and its one field — no fixed-size empty
     space is reserved beneath or beside them (`ImGuiWindowFlags_AlwaysAutoResize`, unchanged from
     REQ-024, plus the now-content-driven field width);
  3. this applies identically to all three fields: the point-entry coordinate field, the single
     non-point field (bearing/angle/distance/option/command-name), and the grip-stretch field;
  4. the field never shrinks below a minimum that keeps it clickable and never exceeds roughly half
     the work-area width, so a pathological value cannot obscure the drawing;
  5. REQ-024's existing behavior is unchanged: live tracking until typed, type-to-start seeding,
     select-all-on-refresh for the grip field, Enter/viewport-click commit, and per-state prompt
     text from `CommandInputHint`/`CadPointPromptLabel` (REQ-304) all continue to work exactly as
     before — this requirement touches sizing only, not input behavior;
  6. the box stays fully within the application window near every edge, using the same clamp
     mechanism as before (REQ-024), now driven by the actual (smaller, typically) content width.

## 3D model space requirements

> These cover the move from a plan-view 2D drawing surface to a true 3D model space
> (ADR-025). They are deliberately split into five independently shippable requirements:
> REQ-057 puts Z into the data, REQ-058 puts a camera in front of it, REQ-059/060 are the
> navigation and manipulation surfaces, and REQ-061 carries the camera into paper space.
> Paper-space *sheet* geometry stays 2D throughout — a sheet is 2D by definition
> (ADR-009/013 stores are unchanged).

### REQ-057 — 3D coordinates through the model, IO, and Properties
- Purpose: surveyors work in three dimensions; today elevation is captured but never drawn,
  so terrain, layered utilities and vertical relationships are invisible and uncheckable
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: Every model-space entity carries a Z coordinate — lines, polylines, circles,
  arcs, ellipses, filled regions, text/MTEXT, dimensions and survey points. Z is stored
  **interleaved** with X and Y in every flat geometry store, one uniform convention across all
  geometry (ADR-025 (a), amended 2026-08-11), and **absolutely**, with no `worldDocumentOriginZ`
  (ADR-025 D2 — the local-origin invariant stays X/Y-only). `SurveyPoint::elevation` **is**
  the point's Z: no duplicate field and no conversion step, so existing drawings gain true
  relief with no re-import. Z survives a round-trip through DXF (group 30), DWG and `.gs`.
  The Properties panel displays and edits Z per entity type, and that edit is undoable.
- Acceptance:
  - importing a DXF fixture with non-zero Z and re-exporting reproduces every group-30 value
    within REQ-101 tolerance;
  - a `.gs` saved with 3D geometry reloads with every Z bit-identical;
  - a legacy `.gs` carrying no Z loads with all Z = 0 and renders identically to pre-change;
  - editing Z in Properties moves the entity, and Ctrl+Z restores the previous value;
  - a survey point reports its stored elevation as its Z with no import or conversion step;
  - a circle or filled region survives insert, erase-from-the-middle and undo with its Z still
    attached to the right entity (asserted in tests — the stride-widening regression).
- Owner-layer: Domain (storage), IO (persistence), UI (Properties)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-11 — initial. 2026-08-11 — **amended**: the statement originally specified
  additive parallel Z arrays per ADR-025 D1. That design rested on an incorrect reading of the
  existing strides (`userLinesFlat` and `userPolylineVerts` already carry Z inline). Corrected to
  interleaved XYZ throughout; see the ADR-025 correction note and the decision log.

### REQ-058 — Orbitable 3D camera with ray picking and a UCS work plane
- Purpose: make the third dimension inspectable and drawable-in
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: The model viewport is driven by a camera (eye / target / up → view matrix) with
  selectable orthographic or perspective projection. The user can orbit freely. **Plan view
  with orthographic projection is the startup default and reproduces the previous 2D
  behaviour.** Picking becomes a screen-ray → world-ray test and object snapping resolves in
  3D. Drawing input resolves as ray × the **active work plane (UCS)**, which defaults to the
  world XY plane. Every existing 2D command continues to work unchanged while the camera is
  in plan view.
- Acceptance:
  - plan view renders pixel-comparable to the pre-change build on a reference drawing;
  - endpoint / midpoint / center / intersection snaps resolve correctly from an orbited
    camera, verified against hand-computed coordinates within REQ-101;
  - LINE, ARC, CIRCLE and TEXT drawn on a non-default UCS land on that plane within REQ-101;
  - the existing test suite stays green;
  - the REQ-100 frame budget is met while orbiting;
  - **every entity type** — not only lines — snaps, previews and commits at the correct elevation
    under an orbited view;
  - **snap glyphs face the viewer** at any orientation rather than lying in the work plane, where
    they foreshorten to an unreadable edge near a horizontal view. They are UI markers, not geometry.
- Owner-layer: Renderer (matrices, draw), UI / Commands (input, picking, snap)
- Status: accepted — **SIGNED OFF 2026-08-12.** Every acceptance condition is met:
  plan-view parity (asserted by `CameraTests`, not assumed); snaps from an orbited camera;
  intersection snaps (REQ-062 / TASK-038 — the snap named here did not exist until then);
  **every entity type** snapping, previewing and committing at the correct elevation (TASK-036
  closed GAP-1/GAP-3, fourteen defects across six pipeline stages); screen-facing snap glyphs
  (TASK-037 closed GAP-2); the suite green; and the REQ-100 frame budget measured at p95 8.93 ms
  against 16 ms (TASK-039) — **re-measured under MSVC 2026-08-15 at p95 9.27 ms, still met**
  (TASK-052).
- Revisions: 2026-08-11 — initial. 2026-08-11 — acceptance extended with the two conditions above
  once 3D drawing was actually exercised: "it works for lines" did not generalise, and a snap glyph
  built as flat world geometry is unreadable in a near-horizontal view.
  2026-08-12 — signed off. The prior status ("only LINE is carried through; CIRCLE is known broken")
  had been stale since TASK-036 and is superseded.

### REQ-059 — ViewCube (view navigation widget)
- Purpose: direct, discoverable view control and continuous orientation feedback
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A **labelled ViewCube surrounded by a W/N/S/E compass ring** occupies the model
  viewport's top-right corner and tracks the camera orientation continuously. Appearance follows
  the mockup supplied with the original feature request. The widget carries:
  - **six labelled faces** — TOP, BOTTOM, FRONT, BACK, LEFT, RIGHT — each label drawn on its face
    whenever that face is visible, shrunk to fit rather than omitted;
  - **two rotation arrows** that square the view up with the next compass direction (N/E/S/W)
    clockwise or counter-clockwise, **relative to the active coordinate system** — under a rotated
    UCS they square to the UCS's north, not the world's;
  - a **home button** that sets the SW isometric view (azimuth 45° from the active coordinate
    system, elevation atan(1/√2) ≈ 35.264°).
  Clicking a face sets the camera to that standard view. **Every orientation change the widget
  initiates is animated**, not snapped — a hard jump makes it easy to lose track of which way the
  model turned. A manual orbit cancels an animation in flight.
- Acceptance:
  - clicking TOP, FRONT and a side face each set the camera to the corresponding standard view;
  - every visible face shows its label, including the long ones (BOTTOM, FRONT, RIGHT);
  - each rotation arrow moves the view to the next quarter turn **even when already square**, and
    preserves the current elevation — it is a rotation, not a view preset;
  - the home button reaches SW isometric from any starting orientation;
  - after any orbit the cube's displayed orientation matches the camera;
  - **a click anywhere on the widget — face, arrow or home — never reaches the viewport behind it**
    and in particular never begins a selection; geometry outside the widget still picks normally;
  - orientation changes ease to the target and settle within 0.5 s, taking the short way around the
    compass; a manual orbit during one takes over immediately;
  - **in plan view (the startup default) the widget is legible** — this is the condition the first
    implementation failed.
- Owner-layer: UI
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-11 — initial. 2026-08-11 — amended to ImOGuizmo's stock axis-ball after
  FINDING-2 (the adopted dependency could not render the mockup unmodified). 2026-08-11 —
  **amended back**: shipped and observed, the axis-ball collapses to a point in plan view and
  conveyed no orientation, so the cube is now built in-tree and the mockup is the target again.
  The legibility clause above was added so this cannot regress silently.

### REQ-060 — 3D manipulation gizmo for the current selection
- Purpose: direct manipulation instead of coordinate entry
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: With a selection active, a translate / rotate / scale gizmo operates on it in 3D,
  driven by the REQ-058 camera matrices. Each gizmo drag is a single undoable operation and
  produces the same result as the equivalent MOVE / ROTATE / SCALE command.
- Acceptance:
  - translate, rotate and scale each move the selection as displayed, and one Ctrl+Z restores
    the prior state in a single step;
  - a gizmo drag and the equivalent typed command produce coordinates agreeing within REQ-101;
  - no gizmo is drawn when the selection is empty.
- Owner-layer: UI (widget), Commands (apply + undo)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-11 — initial.

### REQ-061 — Per-viewport camera in paper space
- Purpose: put a plan view and an isometric on the same sheet
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: `PaperLayout` geometry remains 2D paper inches (ADR-009/013 stores unchanged).
  Each `Viewport` gains a stored camera direction, up vector and projection, persisted
  additively in `.gs`. Screen rendering and the PDF plot each render a viewport's model
  content from that viewport's own camera.
- Acceptance:
  - a layout with two viewports — one plan, one isometric — renders both correctly on screen
    and plots both correctly to PDF;
  - a legacy `.gs` loads with every viewport in plan view and renders identically to
    pre-change.
- Owner-layer: Domain (data), Renderer (draw), IO (`.gs` + plot)
- Status: accepted — **implemented 2026-08-31** (GitHub issue #175, split from #155). `Viewport`
  carries `cam{Azimuth,Elevation,Roll}Deg` + `camPerspective`/`camFovDeg`, defaulting to the
  straight-down orthographic plan view; `render/ViewportProjection.hpp`
  (`ModelToPaperInThroughCamera`) is the one projection, delegating to `ModelToPaperIn` bit-for-bit
  in plan view. The on-screen viewport overlay (`CadUi.cpp`) and the PDF plot (`PdfPlot.cpp`) both
  route model linework through it; the Viewports window offers Plan / iso / elevation standard
  views. `.gs` persists the camera additively (no version bump); a legacy file loads all-plan.
  **Deferred to follow-up:** viewport TEXT/dimension/table glyphs still project their anchor at
  Z = 0, and interactive draw-inside-a-viewport (floating model space) assumes a plan camera.
- Revisions: 2026-08-11 — initial. 2026-08-31 — implemented (issue #175).

### REQ-062 — Intersection and apparent-intersection object snaps
- Purpose: snap to where objects meet — and, in a 3D view, to where they only *look* like they meet
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: Two new object snaps join the existing set.
  **Intersection** returns a point where two objects genuinely meet in 3D: their XY paths cross
  *and* their elevations agree at that crossing within REQ-101. **Apparent intersection** returns a
  point where two objects cross **as projected into the current view** but need not meet in space —
  the case a plan view cannot distinguish and an orbited one makes obvious. Where the two candidate
  3D points differ, apparent intersection returns the one **nearer the camera**: the object the user
  is visually pointing at. Both are per-type toggles alongside Endpoint / Midpoint / Center, persist
  in user preferences and `.gs`, and appear in the Shift+right-click snap-override menu.
  Coverage is every drawable pair of line segments, polyline edges, arcs, circles and ellipses.
  Intersections are computed analytically wherever a closed form exists and refined numerically
  otherwise; a tessellated approximation does not satisfy REQ-101 and is not acceptable.
- Acceptance:
  - two segments that cross in XY at the same elevation report an Intersection snap at the crossing,
    verified against hand-computed coordinates within REQ-101;
  - the same two segments at elevations differing by more than REQ-101 report **no** Intersection —
    and do report an Apparent intersection whenever the view projects them across each other;
  - a line crossing a circle reports both intersection points at the exact analytic coordinates, not
    the chord approximations a tessellated circle would give (a 24-chord arc is off by ~0.86 ft at
    r = 100, which is 86× REQ-101);
  - an intersection outside an arc's sweep, or beyond a segment's ends, is not reported;
  - apparent intersection follows the view: two skew objects that cross on screen stop reporting a
    snap once the camera orbits so their projections separate;
  - in plan view an Apparent intersection at equal elevations coincides with the Intersection.
- Owner-layer: util (pure intersection math), viewport (snap), UI (toggles, menu, glyph)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial.

### REQ-063 — Triangle mesh entity
- Purpose: hold imported 3D model geometry that GoSurvey does not author
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A new entity type stores a triangle mesh: interleaved XYZ positions (architecture
  §11.8), a vertex normal per position, triangle indices, and a per-mesh material colour. Meshes are
  grouped into named **parts** so one imported model keeps its object structure — a pipe run remains
  distinguishable from a valve. Meshes are **reference geometry, not draftable**: GoSurvey does not
  create or edit them, they carry no linetype or lineweight, and no command modifies their vertices.
  They participate in layers, visibility, selection, delete, and view extents; they are excluded from
  object snapping (REQ-064 covers what snapping, if anything, they get) and from DXF/DWG export,
  which has no lossless representation for them.
- Acceptance:
  - a mesh of N triangles round-trips through `.gs` with vertex positions bit-identical on reload;
  - a legacy `.gs` with no mesh section loads unchanged;
  - meshes are included in zoom-extents and in the drawing's bounding box;
  - erasing a mesh is undoable in one step;
  - a mesh on a frozen or off layer is not drawn, and one on a non-plottable layer is not plotted;
  - memory: a 2-million-triangle model loads and reports its triangle count without exhausting a
    32-bit index space or silently truncating.
- Owner-layer: Domain (store), IO (`.gs`), Renderer (draw)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial draft.

### REQ-064 — Shaded visual styles
- Purpose: make 3D models readable as solids rather than as a thicket of edges
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: The model viewport gains a **visual style** selector with at least
  **2D Wireframe** (today's behaviour, and the default), **Hidden** (wireframe with depth testing,
  so near geometry occludes far), and **Shaded** (filled triangles with diffuse lighting from a
  headlight, plus optional edges). Depth testing is enabled for every style except 2D Wireframe.
  Entity colour resolution is unchanged (REQ-048); shading multiplies it. The style is per-viewport
  state, persisted in `.gs` and in user preferences, and each paper-space viewport (REQ-061) carries
  its own.
- Acceptance:
  - **2D Wireframe renders pixel-identical to the pre-change build on a reference drawing** — the
    existing behaviour is preserved exactly, not approximately;
  - in Hidden and Shaded, a near object occludes a far one, and the draw-order artefacts that a
    depth-less renderer shows under orbit are gone;
  - in Shaded, a curved surface shows a lighting gradient rather than a flat fill, and the lighting
    follows the camera when orbiting;
  - switching styles does not alter geometry, selection, snapping results, or the plot;
  - the REQ-100 frame budget is met in Shaded at the REQ-063 mesh density chosen for the bench.
- Owner-layer: Renderer (draw), UI (selector), IO (persistence)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12) — **fully delivered 2026-08-15.** The last unverified condition, the
  frame budget in Shaded, now has a measurement behind it: REQ-100's profile (b) exists (TASK-053)
  and reports **p95 1.97 ms** at 2,000,000 triangles in Shaded on the RTX 5060, against a 16 ms
  budget. On the integrated GPU the same scene is 21.40 ms and fails — see BUG-013, which decides
  which of those two the budget is judged on.
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial draft. Supersedes ADR-025 ASSUMPTION-1, which deliberately left
  depth testing off pending a visual-style requirement; this is that requirement.

### REQ-065 — glTF / GLB model import
- Purpose: get real 3D models — plant, structural, scanned-and-modelled — into the drawing
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: GoSurvey imports 3D models into REQ-063 meshes from **glTF 2.0** (`.gltf` + external
  buffers, and self-contained `.glb`), **STL** (binary and ASCII), and **DWG** — the last by driving
  an installed AutoCAD to explode and tessellate its 3D solids, because a DWG's 3D content may be
  vendor custom objects that only the vendor's own enabler can decode (ADR-026 Context, amended
  2026-08-12). One command accepts all three; the user picks a file and does not have to know which
  route it takes. STL carries no colour or object names, and the DWG route goes through STL, so both
  produce a single unnamed part — **reported at import**, not left to be discovered.
  Node hierarchy is flattened to world space with each node's transform applied,
  and node names are kept as part names. Base-colour factors from PBR materials become per-mesh
  colours; textures, animation, cameras, lights, skins and morph targets are **out of scope and
  reported as skipped**, never dropped silently (REQ-201). The import prompts for a unit scale and an
  insertion point, defaulting to the file's declared units where present, because model authoring
  units (commonly inches or millimetres) rarely match a survey drawing's feet. Imported coordinates
  are converted to the local storage frame in double before being stored (the local-storage
  invariant), so a model placed at state-plane coordinates keeps sub-hundredth precision.
- Acceptance:
  - a `.glb` of known triangle count imports with that exact count, and its bounding box matches the
    source dimensions within REQ-101 after the unit scale;
  - a nested node hierarchy with non-identity transforms lands in the right place — verified against
    hand-computed coordinates for at least one doubly-nested node;
  - per-node names and base colours survive, so an imported model is not one undifferentiated blob;
  - a file containing textures/animation imports its geometry and **states in the log what it
    skipped**;
  - a malformed or truncated file is rejected with a specific message and leaves the drawing
    unchanged — no partial import;
  - importing at state-plane coordinates keeps vertex precision within REQ-101;
  - a binary and an ASCII STL of the same solid import to the same triangle count and bounds, and a
    binary STL whose header begins "solid" is not misread as ASCII;
  - selecting a `.dwg` imports its 3D solids without any pre-conversion step by the user, and states
    which converter was used and what the route dropped;
  - a `.dwg` is never modified by the import — the conversion explodes a copy;
  - when no capable converter is installed, the import says so specifically (a DWG→DXF-only
    converter is not sufficient and must be named as such), and changes nothing.
- Owner-layer: IO (parsers + conversion), Domain (store), UI (prompt), Platform (process, dialog)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial draft. Route chosen over OBJ/FBX/STL — see ADR-026 and the
  decision log.

### REQ-066 — Raw description on survey points
- Purpose: let a point group match the field code even after the description has been edited
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `SurveyPoint` gains a **`rawDescription`** field holding the description as collected in
  the field. It is written once at import and is **never rewritten** by description expansion or by
  a user edit of `description`; the two are independent. It is persisted additively in `.gs` and in
  the `GOSURVEY` DXF XDATA schema (ADR-005), so neither format gains a version bump. A record with no
  raw description — every point in every drawing written before this requirement — loads with the
  field empty, and any consumer that matches on it falls back to `description`.
- Acceptance:
  - a point imported with a field code keeps that code in `rawDescription` after `description` is
    edited to something else;
  - a legacy `.gs`, and a legacy DXF point carrying the pre-REQ-066 XDATA, both load with
    `rawDescription` empty and are matched on `description` instead — not skipped, not defaulted to
    the description's text;
  - `rawDescription` round-trips `.gs` and DXF unchanged, including when empty.
- Owner-layer: Domain (field), IO (`.gs`, DXF XDATA)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial. Raised while specifying REQ-067: raw-description matching was
  requested and no raw description was stored anywhere.

### REQ-067 — Point groups
- Purpose: name a set of survey points once and reuse it — chiefly as a surface's data source
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A **point group** is a named, persisted, drawing-owned object whose membership is a
  **rule**, not a frozen list. A rule combines any of: **point-id ranges** (`1-500, 1200,
  1400-1450`), a **description** wildcard, a **raw-description** wildcard (REQ-066), and an
  **explicit id list** picked in the drawing. **Criteria combine as a union (OR)**: a point joins the
  group if it matches *any* filled-in criterion, and an empty criterion contributes nothing rather
  than matching everything. So `ids 1-500` + `desc EG*` resolves to every point numbered 1–500 plus
  every `EG` point, and a hand-picked point is always in its own group regardless of the other
  criteria. Narrowing a group by exclusion is **not** in this release. Membership is evaluated on
  demand from the current point set, so points imported after the group was defined join it without
  the group being edited; the explicit-id part is by definition unaffected by new points. A group is **not an entity**: it
  has no geometry, no layer, no colour, is not drawn, is not selectable in the viewport, and is not
  exported. Groups are owned by the drawing and are undoable, so creating or editing one can be
  undone in a single step. A point that is deleted leaves no trace in any group.
- Acceptance:
  - a group defined as `EG*` resolves to exactly the points whose description matches and to no
    others; the same rule against `rawDescription` resolves independently of an edited description;
  - importing further `EG` points and re-resolving includes them with no edit to the group;
  - an id-range rule `1-10, 20-30` excludes 11–19, and includes both endpoints;
  - an explicit-id group is unchanged by newly imported points;
  - deleting a point removes it from every group's resolved membership and leaves no dangling id
    behind in the stored rule;
  - a rule that matches nothing resolves to an empty group and says so — it is not an error, and it
    is not silently treated as "all points" (REQ-201);
  - a group with **no** criterion filled resolves to **empty**, not to every point — the difference
    between "no filter" and "match everything" is exactly the mistake that would silently put a whole
    drawing into a surface;
  - a rule with two criteria filled resolves to the **union** of their matches, and a hand-picked id
    stays in the group even when it matches neither wildcard nor any id range;
  - groups round-trip `.gs`, and a legacy `.gs` with no group section loads unchanged.

- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial.
  2026-08-15 — **criteria combine as a union (OR), and exclusion is out of scope.** "Combines any of"
  was ambiguous enough to change what the feature does, and it was resolved by the user before any
  code rather than guessed at (workflow §5). OR is what makes the hand-pick list meaningful: under
  AND, a manually picked point outside the id range would be dropped from its own group. Also
  pinned down: an all-empty rule resolves to **empty**, never to "all points".

### REQ-068 — TIN surface entity
- Purpose: hold a triangulated terrain model — the object every other surface requirement acts on
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A **surface** is a named, drawing-owned object holding a triangulation: interleaved XYZ
  vertices (architecture §11.8), triangle indices, and the per-triangle adjacency that contouring and
  analysis need. The triangulation is **immutable once built and replaced wholesale on rebuild**, and
  is therefore held as `shared_ptr<const>` by both the live state and every undo snapshot
  (architecture §11.5, as amended 2026-08-12) — a surface must not be deep-copied by unrelated edits.
  Surfaces participate in layers, visibility, selection, erase, undo and view extents. They are
  **excluded from DXF and DWG export**, which has no representation GoSurvey can write losslessly,
  and the exclusion is **stated in the export log** (REQ-201), never silent. A surface is persisted in
  `.gs` in an additive section.
- Acceptance:
  - a surface round-trips `.gs` with vertex positions bit-identical on reload;
  - a legacy `.gs` with no surface section loads unchanged;
  - surfaces are included in zoom-extents and in the drawing's bounding box;
  - erasing a surface is undoable in one step, and the restored surface is the same triangulation;
  - a surface on a frozen or off layer is not drawn, and one on a non-plottable layer is not plotted;
  - **an edit unrelated to the surface — drawing a line — does not copy the triangulation**: the
    undo snapshot shares the payload, asserted on the shared pointer rather than by inspection;
  - exporting a drawing containing a surface names the surface as excluded in the log.
- Owner-layer: Domain (store), IO (`.gs`), Renderer (draw)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial.

### REQ-069 — Surface definition: point groups, breaklines, boundaries, dynamic rebuild
- Purpose: make a surface a live model of its inputs rather than a one-time snapshot
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A surface stores an **ordered, editable definition** whose items are **point groups**
  (REQ-067), **breaklines** (existing 3D lines and polylines designated as such), **contour
  polylines** (REQ-129), and **boundaries** (closed polylines typed **outer**, **hide**, **show**, or
  **clip** — REQ-128). Breaklines, contour sources and boundaries are referenced
  by **stable entity id** (REQ-076), never by array index. Triangulation is **constrained**: no
  triangle edge crosses a breakline or contour source. Boundaries apply in definition order — an
  outer boundary clips the surface to itself, a hide boundary removes surface inside it, a show
  boundary restores surface inside a hide, and a **clip** boundary excludes input points outside it
  before triangulation (REQ-128). Standard breaklines only; proximity, wall and non-destructive
  breaklines are out of scope. A named surface with too little data to triangulate is still a
  surface (REQ-124): the definition exists, `tin` is null, and the next source edit rebuilds.

  The surface is **dynamic**: when a definition source changes — a consumed point moves or is
  deleted, a breakline or boundary polyline is edited, a group's membership changes — the surface is
  marked out of date and **retriangulates**, with no user action. Rebuild is **coalesced to at most
  one per command / undo boundary**, so an edit touching many sources rebuilds once, not once per
  source. The rebuild runs **off the UI thread** (architecture §8): the edit completes immediately,
  the surface is visibly marked stale until the result arrives, and **a result whose definition is no
  longer current — because of an undo or a further edit — is discarded, not applied**. Deleting a
  referenced entity removes that item from the definition; it never leaves a dangling reference.

  Inputs that have no correct answer are **reported, not absorbed** (REQ-001, REQ-201): breaklines
  that cross in plan at different elevations, duplicate points at the same plan location with
  different elevations, and a definition that yields fewer than three non-collinear points each
  produce a specific message stating what the build did.
- Acceptance:
  - a breakline across a saddle produces triangle edges along it, and **no triangle crosses it**,
    verified against hand-computed expected edges on a committed dataset;
  - an outer boundary clips the surface to itself; a hide boundary leaves a void; a show boundary
    inside a hide restores surface there;
  - moving a survey point the surface consumes changes the surface with no manual rebuild;
  - a single MOVE of N consumed points triggers **one** rebuild, not N;
  - undo issued while a rebuild is in flight leaves the surface consistent with the undone state —
    the in-flight result is discarded;
  - deleting a polyline used as a breakline removes it from the definition, and the surface rebuilds
    without it, with no dangling id;
  - crossing breaklines at different elevations produce a named diagnostic and a stated outcome;
  - a definition of fewer than three non-collinear points fails with a specific message and leaves no
    partial TIN — the named surface object remains (REQ-124);
  - the definition round-trips `.gs`, ids intact.
- Owner-layer: Domain (definition, rebuild), util (triangulation), Commands (designate/edit)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial. 2026-08-27 — D-2026-08-27-a: contour sources (REQ-129), clip
  (REQ-128), and empty named surfaces (REQ-124).

### REQ-070 — Surface styles
- Purpose: control what a surface looks like without changing what it is
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A **surface style** is a named, reusable, drawing-owned object referenced by surfaces —
  the ADR-020 text-style pattern, a document-owned table rather than a per-surface copy, so editing a
  style changes every surface using it. A style controls: **minor and major contour interval**, each
  with colour and lineweight; **triangle** display; **surface border**; **point** display; and the
  REQ-072 band and arrow settings. **Contours are display geometry, not entities**: they are
  regenerated from the triangulation and the style, are never stored in `.gs`, never appear in
  selection, and never appear in the drawing's entity counts. Changing a style property must not
  re-triangulate the surface.
- Acceptance:
  - changing the contour interval updates the display **without rebuilding the triangulation** and
    adds no entity to the drawing or to the saved `.gs`;
  - two surfaces sharing a style both change when the style is edited;
  - a style with triangles off and contours on draws only contours; with both off and border on,
    only the border;
  - a major interval that is not a whole multiple of the minor interval is rejected with a specific
    message rather than producing mis-labelled contours;
  - styles round-trip `.gs`; a legacy `.gs` loads unchanged; a surface whose style was deleted falls
    back to a default style rather than failing to draw.
- Owner-layer: Domain (table), Renderer (draw), UI (editor), IO (`.gs`)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial.

### REQ-071 — Contour extraction
- Purpose: get contours out as real geometry when they must be edited, labelled or handed over
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A command bakes a surface's **currently displayed** contours into ordinary polyline
  entities on a chosen layer. The result is normal drawing geometry — editable, snappable, exportable
  — and is **deliberately not linked to the surface**: a later rebuild does not change it, and it is
  not removed when the surface is erased. The command reports how many polylines it created at which
  interval (REQ-201).
- Acceptance:
  - extraction produces polylines at exactly the displayed contour elevations, each vertex within
    REQ-101 of the linear interpolation along the triangle edge it came from;
  - extracting twice produces two independent sets, neither affecting the other;
  - rebuilding the surface afterwards leaves already-extracted polylines untouched;
  - the created count and interval are reported;
  - extracting from a surface whose style has contours disabled creates nothing and says so, rather
    than silently extracting a hidden interval.
- Owner-layer: Commands, Domain
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial.

### REQ-072 — Elevation banding, slope banding, and slope arrows
- Purpose: read grade and drainage off the surface directly — the reason the surface exists
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A surface style carries an editable **range table** — band count, breakpoints, and a
  colour per band — driving per-triangle colouring by **elevation**, by **slope**, or by **direction /
  aspect** (REQ-130), with an on-screen **legend** whose ranges are the table's. Separately, **slope
  arrows** draw per triangle in the downhill direction of that triangle's plane, coloured by grade.
  Banding, arrows and the plain style display are independent toggles. One table, one mode at a time
  — a triangle has one colour.
- Acceptance:
  - a triangle of known elevation and of known slope each take the colour their band prescribes,
    including at an exact breakpoint, where the band a value falls into is defined and tested rather
    than left to float comparison;
  - the legend's displayed ranges equal the table's, and change with it;
  - on a planar tilted surface every arrow points the same direction, and that direction matches the
    hand-computed downhill vector within REQ-101;
  - a perfectly flat triangle produces no arrow direction and is drawn as flat rather than as an
    arbitrary direction;
  - turning banding off restores the style's plain display unchanged.
- Owner-layer: Domain (band assignment), Renderer (draw), UI (table + legend)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial. 2026-08-27 — D-2026-08-27-a: direction/aspect is REQ-130's third
  mode; this requirement's elevation/slope/arrow conditions are unchanged.

### REQ-073 — Surface-to-surface volumes, and a live Volume Dashboard
- Purpose: earthwork — the number a grading design is judged by, kept current as either surface
  changes rather than re-run by hand
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: Given two surfaces, GoSurvey reports **cut**, **fill** and **net** volume over the area
  the two have **in common**, together with that common area, and offers a cut/fill colour map over
  the same region. The comparison region is stated explicitly in the result, because a volume quoted
  without the area it covers is not a result. **Cut, fill and net are reported in cubic yards**
  (computed in cubic feet, displayed as ft³ / 27). Common area remains square feet.

  **Bounded volumes** (REQ-131) use the same comparison, limited to a closed clip region.

  A **Volume Dashboard** panel (2026-08-23 amendment) picks two surfaces from the drawing and holds
  the report on screen: cut, fill, net, the common area, and the cut/fill map toggle, all in one
  place rather than a one-shot command result that scrolls away. The dashboard is **live**: when
  either selected surface's triangulation is replaced — REQ-069's dynamic rebuild, or a fresh
  triangulation from any source — the dashboard recomputes with **no user action**, the same
  dynamic-recompute pattern REQ-069 established for a surface's own triangulation, reusing
  architecture §8's one-shot-worker contract (generation staleness + cooperative cancellation) rather
  than a new mechanism. The panel is visibly marked stale until the new result lands, and a result
  computed against a selection that is no longer current — because the panel's surface pick changed,
  or an undo landed, while the compute was in flight — is **discarded, not applied**, mirroring
  REQ-069's own rule for exactly the same failure shape. Recompute is **coalesced to at most one per
  relevant change**: a rebuild that itself coalesced many edits into one (REQ-069) triggers one
  dashboard recompute, not one per edit it absorbed. The panel is UI/session state — which two
  surfaces are picked, and whether the panel is open — and is **not persisted to `.gs`**, the same
  choice REQ-075's Surface Manager makes for its own selection state.
- Acceptance:
  - two planar surfaces offset by a known constant over a known common area report cut, fill and net
    within a stated tolerance of the hand-computed value;
  - two surfaces that do not overlap report zero volume and say so, rather than reporting a number
    derived from no common area;
  - partial overlap reports volumes over the overlap only, and states the common area used;
  - the cut/fill map colours cut and fill distinctly and shows nothing outside the common area;
  - comparing a surface with itself reports zero net within tolerance;
  - rebuilding either dashboard-selected surface (REQ-069) updates the reported volume with no user
    action, and the dashboard shows a stale/computing state until the new result lands;
  - a single rebuild that coalesces N edits into one (REQ-069) triggers exactly one dashboard
    recompute, not N;
  - undo, or changing the panel's surface pick, while a recompute is in flight leaves the dashboard
    showing a result consistent with the CURRENT selection — the in-flight result is discarded;
  - picking a surface that is itself out of date (mid-rebuild) is reflected as such rather than
    computing a volume against a stale triangulation;
  - closing and reopening the panel, or saving and reloading the drawing, does not change which
    surfaces are selectable or force a recompute that current data already answered.
- Owner-layer: Domain (compute + the async worker), UI (dashboard panel + map)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial. 2026-08-23 — amended (D-2026-08-23-k) to add the Volume Dashboard
  panel and make it live: recompute-on-rebuild, staleness marking, and discard-of-stale-results,
  mirroring REQ-069's own pattern rather than inventing a second one. 2026-08-27 — cut/fill/net
  display is cubic yards (ft³/27); compute unchanged.

### REQ-074 — Spot elevation and grade readout
- Purpose: the constant, small question while grading — how high is it here, and what is the grade
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Picking a location on a surface reports the **interpolated elevation** at that point.
  Picking two reports **grade**, **slope percentage**, and the horizontal and vertical distance
  between them. A pick outside the surface reports that it is outside; it never extrapolates.
- Acceptance:
  - elevation at a point inside a triangle of known plane equals the planar interpolation within
    REQ-101;
  - a pick outside the surface, or inside a hide-boundary void, reports "outside surface" and no
    elevation;
  - grade between two points on a known plane matches the hand-computed value within REQ-101;
  - two picks at the same location report zero distance rather than dividing by zero.
- Owner-layer: Commands, UI
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial.

### REQ-075 — Surface Manager
- Purpose: one place to see and edit every surface in the drawing
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Toolspace Prospector is the place to **edit the definition** (add, remove point groups,
  breaklines, contour sources, boundaries, point-file links — REQ-069). The **Surfaces** window
  (Survey ribbon / left-click a named surface) edits **style and analysis** (REQ-070 / REQ-072), not
  the definition tree. A surface can still be created empty from Toolspace (REQ-124). Force rebuild
  is on the Surfaces collection menu and on each surface. For each surface the old manager still
  shows point count, triangle count, elevation range, and stale/rebuilding state when that panel is
  opened.
- Acceptance:
  - every REQ-069 definition operation is reachable from Toolspace Prospector on the surface's
    Definition (and Masks) nodes;
  - a rebuild is reflected in displayed counts where those readouts exist;
  - a surface that is out of date or rebuilding is shown as such, and the state clears when the
    rebuild lands;
  - deleting a surface from the panel is undoable in one step;
  - renaming to a name already in use is refused with a specific message.
- Owner-layer: UI, Commands
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial. 2026-08-27 — D-2026-08-27-a: empty create (REQ-124) and contour
  sources (REQ-129) are reachable from the panel. 2026-08-28 — D-2026-08-28-c: definition editing
  moves to Toolspace; the Surfaces window is style/analysis.

### REQ-076 — Stable entity identity
- Purpose: let one object reference another and survive an erase
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: Every drawing entity carries a **stable identity** — a per-drawing monotonically
  increasing id, assigned at creation, **persisted in `.gs`, and never reused** within a drawing, so
  a reference to a deleted entity resolves to nothing rather than to whatever later took its array
  slot. Cross-object references (a surface's breaklines and boundaries, a survey point's label) are
  stored **by id, never by array index**. Entities loaded from a drawing written before this
  requirement are assigned ids on load, in a deterministic order, so a legacy file is not a special
  case anywhere above IO. Resolving an id to an entity is by an index built on demand — no
  per-entity map is stored, and no reference-fixup pass runs at erase.
- Acceptance:
  - an entity's id is unchanged by erasing a different entity, by undo/redo, by copy/paste, and by a
    `.gs` save/load round trip;
  - a reference to an erased entity resolves to **nothing**, and specifically not to the entity that
    moved into its former index;
  - a pasted copy of an entity receives a **new** id, distinct from its source's;
  - a legacy `.gs` loads with ids assigned deterministically — loading the same file twice yields the
    same ids;
  - ids are not reused after an erase within a session, and are still not reused after a save/load;
  - `SurveyPoint`'s annotation-label reference is migrated to an id, and the index-fixup loop in
    `EraseCadAnnotationAtIndex` is deleted rather than duplicated.
- Owner-layer: Domain (id allocation + resolution), IO (`.gs`)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-12)
- Revisions: 2026-08-12 — initial. Raised as a blocking Verification finding against REQ-069: the
  codebase addresses entities by array index and compacts on erase, so a stored reference silently
  re-points to a different entity. See ADR-027 and the decision log.

### REQ-077 — The application knows its version and checks its channel for a newer one
- Purpose: a user runs a current build without having to go looking for one
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: The application carries its own version, derived from a **single source** — the CMake
  `project(VERSION)` — so that the binary, the installer, the git tag and the release title cannot
  disagree. The version is displayed in the UI. On startup the application asks its configured
  **release channel** (`stable` or `beta`) whether a newer version exists, by fetching a small JSON
  manifest over HTTPS.

  The check runs **on every launch** and **gates the session**: until it finishes, the application
  shows a modal "Checking for updates" dialog with a progress indicator and accepts no other input.
  The user therefore always knows the state of their install before doing any work, and can never
  begin a drawing on a build that is about to ask to replace itself.

  Two properties keep that from becoming a hang. The fetch still runs **off the UI thread** — a
  blocked UI thread cannot repaint, so the progress indicator could not animate and Windows would
  mark the app "Not Responding"; the thread is what makes the modal honest rather than frozen. And
  the check is **hard-bounded by a short timeout**, after which it gives up and the session starts.

  On any failure — no network, DNS failure, timeout, malformed JSON, HTTP error — the dialog closes
  and the application proceeds exactly as if no update existed, with nothing shown to the user. A
  setting disables the check outright, in which case no dialog appears and no request is made.
- Acceptance:
  - the version shown in the UI, the version embedded in the executable's Windows version resource,
    the installer's `AppVersion`, and the git tag all derive from the one CMake value — changing that
    value changes all of them and no other edit is required;
  - **every** launch with the check enabled performs the check — two launches a minute apart both
    issue a request;
  - the checking dialog blocks all other interaction until it resolves, and the application remains
    responsive and repainting throughout (never "Not Responding");
  - with the network unreachable, the session starts within the stated timeout and shows no error;
  - each of no-network, timeout, HTTP 404/500, and malformed JSON leaves the application running
    normally with no error shown to the user — the failure is logged, not surfaced (this is the
    deliberate, recorded exception to REQ-201; see the decision log);
  - a `stable` install is never offered a prerelease;
  - with the setting disabled, no dialog appears and no network request is made at any time;
  - version ordering is correct across the prerelease boundary — `0.5.0-beta.2` < `0.5.0-beta.10` <
    `0.5.0`, and an equal or older remote version produces no prompt.
- Owner-layer: util (version compare + manifest parse, pure), Platform (HTTPS transport), UI
  (version display + checking dialog + setting), IO (`UserPrefs` channel)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-15)
- Revisions: 2026-08-15 — initial. See ADR-029 and the decision log.
  2026-08-15 — **amended: the check now gates startup instead of hiding behind it.** The 24-hour
  throttle is removed (it made "checks when the app opens" false roughly half the time), and the
  non-blocking, invisible check is replaced by a modal with a progress indicator. This reverses the
  original "a user must not be able to tell the feature is present" in favour of "a user always
  knows what build they are about to work on" — a deliberate user decision, recorded in the
  decision log, not a drift. The off-thread fetch survives the change for a technical reason rather
  than a policy one: it is what allows the modal to animate and stay responsive.

### REQ-078 — An update is applied only after the user chooses it
- Purpose: keep the user in control of when their CAD session ends
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: When REQ-077 finds a newer version, the application **presents it and waits**. It
  displays the new version, the current version, and the release notes carried in the manifest,
  offering exactly three outcomes: install now, be reminded at the next launch, or skip this version
  permanently. There is no silent download and no silent install — this application holds unsaved
  drawings, and an unannounced restart destroys work.

  On the user's choice to install, the application downloads the installer, **verifies it against the
  SHA-256 recorded in the manifest**, and refuses to execute it on any mismatch. Before handing over,
  it routes through the existing unsaved-changes path, so a user with a dirty drawing is asked to
  save rather than losing it to the restart. The installer is then run non-interactively and the
  application exits; the installer replaces the files and relaunches the application.

  The hash is an **integrity** check, not an authenticity one: it and the installer come from the same
  host over the same TLS connection, so it detects corruption and a truncated download, not a
  compromised publisher. Authenticity requires Authenticode signing, which is recorded as technical
  debt rather than claimed (see the decision log).
  **Compatibility is stated before the user accepts, not discovered afterwards.** The manifest
  carries the `.gs` format version the offered build writes, and the dialog compares it against
  this build's. Two distinct outcomes are shown differently, because collapsing them would train
  users to ignore both:
  - **forward-only** (the offered build writes a newer format) — routine, stated plainly: existing
    drawings still open, but drawings saved afterwards will not open in the installed version;
  - **breaking** (existing drawings will not open) — prominent, and **declared by the release
    author**, because a semantic break need not move the format version and so cannot be detected
    automatically.

  A warning informs the choice; it never removes it. The three buttons are unchanged.
- Acceptance:
  - no download begins, and no installer runs, without an explicit user click;
  - an offered build writing a newer `.gs` format shows the forward-only notice; one at the same
    format shows nothing; a declared break shows the prominent warning and the author's text;
  - a manifest with no compatibility information (one published before the field existed) warns
    about nothing rather than treating absence as risk;
  - the compatibility notice appears **above** the release notes, not below them;
  - "Skip this version" suppresses that version permanently but a *later* version still prompts;
  - "Remind me later" prompts again on the next launch;
  - a deliberately corrupted download fails the hash check, is deleted, does not execute, and reports
    the failure to the user (REQ-201 applies here — unlike the REQ-077 check, this path was
    user-initiated, so silence would be wrong);
  - a drawing with unsaved changes triggers the existing unsaved-changes modal before the application
    exits, and cancelling there cancels the update;
  - after the installer runs, the previous versioned executables (`GoSurvey-0.*.exe`) are gone from
    the install directory, one `GoSurvey.exe` remains, and desktop/Start-menu shortcuts and the `.gs`
    file association still resolve;
  - a partially downloaded file left by a killed process does not block or corrupt the next attempt.
- Owner-layer: UI (dialog), Platform (download, hash, process launch), IO (`UserPrefs` skip state)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-15)
- Revisions: 2026-08-15 — initial. See ADR-029 and the decision log.

### REQ-079 — `.gs` files carry a format version and are migrated forward on load
- Purpose: an old drawing opens in a new build, always, and the rare case where it cannot is stated
  rather than discovered
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: Every `.gs` file records the format version that wrote it. A build opens **any file at
  or below its own version**, migrating older ones forward on load; the user is not asked, and the
  file on disk is unchanged until they save.

  Migration runs on the **parsed JSON**, before the typed loader sees it, as a chain of
  single-version steps (v1→v2→v3). Each step is a pure function of the document tree, so a drawing
  five versions old is carried forward by composing steps that were each written and tested against
  one change.

  A file written by a **newer** build is refused — not guessed at — with a message naming the
  version that wrote it and the version this build understands. That is the only case where a
  drawing legitimately does not open, and it is a downgrade, never a loss.

  **Normalization is distinct from migration, and is permitted.** A load may put a drawing into a
  canonical *storage* form without changing what the drawing means. Today there is exactly one such
  step: a file whose coordinates are of state-plane magnitude and whose `worldDocumentOrigin` is
  `(0,0)` has its origin moved to the extents midpoint and its local coordinates rebased, because
  geometry is stored `local` with `world = local + worldDocumentOrigin` and float precision depends on
  the locals being small. This *is* a change to the bytes and is reported to the user, so a normalized
  load is not byte-identical on resave and is not required to be. It must be **idempotent** — the
  origin is then established, so a second load does nothing — and it must not be lossy beyond the
  precision the file already had: the rebase's rounding is bounded by the float spacing of the
  rebased coordinate, which is never coarser than the spacing of the value it replaced.

  Normalization is deliberately *not* open-ended. Adding a second normalization step is a recorded
  decision, not an implementation detail, because every one of them costs a load that rewrites the
  user's file.

  **A change that cannot be expressed as a migration is a breaking change**, and is treated as one:
  it is declared deliberately, surfaced in the update dialog before the user accepts the update
  (REQ-078), and is expected to be rare. Backward compatibility is the default and the burden of
  proof is on breaking it.
- Acceptance:
  - a file at the current version loads with no migration **and no normalization** and is
    byte-identical on resave;
  - **normalization is idempotent**: where a load does normalize (today the only case is the
    large-coordinate origin rebase — see the Statement), the *second* resave is byte-identical to the
    first. One transformation, never a drift that compounds per open/save cycle;
  - a file at an older version loads, and the resulting drawing is equivalent to the same content
    saved at the current version;
  - migrations compose — a file two or more versions old is carried forward through every
    intermediate step in order;
  - a file written by a newer build is refused with a message naming both versions, and the
    application is left in its prior state, not a half-loaded one;
  - a file with a missing, non-integer, or zero/negative version is refused as malformed;
  - a migration that fails reports which step failed and loads nothing;
  - the current build opens every `.gs` in `samples/` (the regression corpus).
- Owner-layer: IO (`GsIo` reader), util/IO (`GsMigrate`, pure)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-15)
- Revisions: 2026-08-15 — initial. Raised on discovering that `.gs` has carried a `version` field
  since the beginning while the reader compared it with `!=`: bumping it would have made **every
  existing drawing unopenable**, so the field was unusable and eleven changes across REQ-044…076
  were forced through a "tolerant key, no version bump" workaround instead. See ADR-030.

  2026-08-17 — **normalization carved out of the byte-identity condition**, and the idempotence
  condition added in its place. Raised by issue #61: the fuzzer's `gs-roundtrip` oracle failed on
  roughly a third of all seeds because loading a drawing with state-plane-magnitude coordinates
  rebases the document origin, so the first resave differed. The requirement as written called that a
  defect; investigation found it is the local-storage design working correctly — for a 5,000 ft survey
  at easting 2e6 the rebase takes float quantization from ~0.25 ft to ~0.0002 ft. The original
  condition was therefore asking the format to promise something the precision design contradicts.
  Amended rather than the code changed, and the weaker promise replaced with a **stronger, testable
  one** (idempotence) so the amendment is not simply an exemption. Decision D-2026-08-17-a.

### REQ-080 — Anonymous install and active-usage telemetry
- Purpose: inform pricing and understand adoption without user accounts or subscriptions
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: The application generates a random 128-bit anonymous install ID on first run and
  persists it in the user preferences file. It sends two fire-and-forget telemetry events:
  - `install` — exactly once, when the install ID is generated
  - `active` — **(amended 2026-08-23, D-2026-08-23-f) on every launch**, reporting current usage.
    This used to be throttled to at most once per rolling 24-hour period; that throttle is gone
    by explicit user decision. No `lastActivePingDate` is tracked or persisted any more — there
    is nothing left to throttle against. The server enforces no per-day dedup either
    (`ux_pings_active_daily` was dropped from `tools/telemetry-worker/schema.sql`), so this table
    now measures **launches**, not daily-active-identities; every analytics query in `queries.sql`
    already used `COUNT(DISTINCT install_id)` rather than `COUNT(*)`, so "how many active users"
    numbers are unaffected — only a query counting rows would be.

  The events are sent via HTTPS POST to a configurable endpoint (the `TelemetryEndpoint`
  constant) as a JSON payload: `installId`, `event`, `version`, `channel`, `os`, and
  `email`.

  **Amended 2026-08-23 (D-2026-08-23-e): this requirement no longer guarantees no PII.**
  The original "no personally identifiable information" promise is reversed by explicit,
  informed user decision — not discovered as a defect, not a Workshop judgment call. When
  the user is signed in (REQ-091) at the moment a ping fires, `email` carries their signed-in
  email address; when signed out, `email` is empty and the ping is exactly as anonymous as
  before. **A ping's firing, throttling, and the `install`/`active` decision remain entirely
  independent of sign-in state** — REQ-091's identity system is not a dependency of REQ-080's
  telemetry, only an optional enrichment of it when both happen to be true at once. No
  username, hostname, path, or hardware fingerprint is ever sent; `email` is the one addition,
  and only when known.

  The telemetry fires in a detached one-shot worker thread once per launch, independent of
  any other background task's own success/failure — but its own firing point is no longer
  "immediately at process start": it fires once REQ-091's launch gate resolves (signed in, or
  the offline exception), so that whatever sign-in state is true at that moment is known
  before the payload is built. This costs no perceptible delay in practice, since the gate
  already blocks all other interaction until it resolves. It must never block the UI, gate a
  session on its OWN account, or fail the application if the network is unavailable. Any
  network error (timeout, DNS failure, unreachable host) is dropped silently. This is the same
  sanctioned silent-failure exception as REQ-077's update check, for the same reason: a
  background reporting call has no actionable user recourse for its own failure.

  Distinction: a ping measures first *run*, not raw downloads. GitHub Releases download counts
  (available freely on the asset page) complement this and measure downloads; this requirement
  measures installs that have executed once.
- Acceptance:
  - on first run, an `install` event is sent exactly once; subsequent runs do not resend it;
  - **(amended 2026-08-23)** on every run after the first, an `active` event is sent exactly once
    per launch, with no throttle — opening the application 5 times in a day produces 5 rows, not
    1; this REPLACES the original "at most once per rolling 24-hour period" condition;
  - the payload JSON is well-formed and contains exactly six fields (installId, event, version,
    channel, os, email);
  - **(amended 2026-08-23)** `email` equals the signed-in email when REQ-091's sign-in state is
    true at the moment the ping fires, and is empty otherwise — a ping never blocks on, waits
    for, or is skipped because of sign-in state;
  - **(amended 2026-08-23)** no username, hostname, file path, or hardware fingerprint is ever
    included — `email` is the only field this requirement adds beyond the original five;
  - network failures (timeout, DNS, unreachable host, TLS error) do not raise an exception, log
    a message, or otherwise fail the application;
  - killing network access does not hang or freeze the startup;
  - a privacy disclosure is present in the settings panel accurately describing current
    behavior — including that a signed-in user's email is sent — not the pre-amendment promise;
  - the current build sends pings to the configured endpoint and an inspector tool confirms the
    payload shape and timing.
- Owner-layer: Platform (PostJson), Telemetry (ping logic + rate limiting), Auth (signed-in
  email, read not owned), IO (persistence)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-16)
- Revisions: 2026-08-16 — initial. Resolved as a SPEC GAP (no prior requirement existed for
  telemetry). User answered three key questions: (1) tracking only, no license-key enforcement
  for now (licensing is deferred); (2) self-hosted endpoint (not third-party analytics vendor);
  (3) no opt-out toggle, always-on anonymous pings (PII-free by design). See ADR-032.
  2026-08-23 — added `email` (D-2026-08-23-e), reversing the original no-PII acceptance
  condition by explicit user decision, made after REQ-091 shipped and the user asked for it
  directly. Scope decided in the same conversation: email only when signed in at ping time;
  the ping's firing/throttling stays fully independent of sign-in state.
  2026-08-23 — removed the 24h throttle (D-2026-08-23-f), reversing the original "at most once
  per rolling 24-hour period" acceptance condition by explicit user decision. An `active` event
  now fires every launch; `lastActivePingDate` is no longer tracked client-side and the server's
  per-day unique index was dropped. This is the third REQ-080 acceptance-condition reversal in
  one day (see D-2026-08-23-e above) — each recorded separately because each was its own
  explicit ask, not one bundled decision.

### REQ-081 — The Dark theme reads as a coherent, separated UI
- Purpose: the shell's panels must be tellable apart at a glance; a uniformly flat
  surface hides where one panel ends and the next begins
- Priority: should
- Type: non-functional (appearance)
- Statement: The **Dark** color theme presents a coherent dark UI in which docked
  panels are distinguishable from each other and from the application ground
  without reading their titles. Concretely:
  - a panel surface is **lighter** than the dockspace ground behind it, and every
    panel/dock node is delimited by a 1 px border **darker** than both — the
    light-surface/dark-gap pairing is what produces the separation;
  - input and property-value fields are **recessed** (darker than the panel
    surface they sit on);
  - a section header inside a panel is a full-width bar distinct from the panel
    surface, with its disclosure triangle at the leading edge;
  - one accent colour marks selection and active state across tabs, headers,
    check marks and slider grabs;
  - Properties coordinate rows carry a fixed-colour **axis badge** — X red,
    Y green, Z blue;
  - chrome painted directly through `ImDrawList` rather than through
    `ImGuiCol_*` (toolbar band, ribbon panels, ribbon buttons, status bar,
    autocomplete popup, property grid) follows the **active** theme instead of
    fixed colours.

  This requirement governs the **shell chrome only**. The drawing viewport is out
  of its scope.
- Acceptance:
  - with Dark active, no chrome element renders in the classic theme's palette
    (the `#464646` / `#3A3A3A` grays or the steel-blue `#3C5575` family);
  - two adjacent docked panels are separated by a visible border line, and the
    panel surface differs from the dockspace ground by a visible value step;
  - switching Options → Display → *Color theme* Dark → Light → Dark leaves each
    theme rendering its own palette, with no colour left over from the other on
    the frame after the switch;
  - the **Light** (nanoCAD classic) theme renders exactly as it does today —
    this work does not change it;
  - viewport contents — crosshair, grips, entity/layer colours, selection
    highlight, snap markers, paper-space sheet — are unchanged;
  - a Properties geometry row whose label ends in X, Y or Z shows the axis badge
    in red, green or blue respectively; a non-axis row (e.g. Radius) shows none.
  - **(added 2026-08-16, revision 2; clause 1 and the accent clause amended by
    revision 3)** the palette is derived, not picked:
    - every neutral is **achromatic** (R = G = B), so no surface carries a colour
      cast and all chroma in the UI belongs to the accent and the semantic
      triad — anything coloured is therefore meaningful;
    - the neutral ladder steps on roughly even **CIE L\*** intervals, and each
      structural relationship (panel over ground, seam under ground, field under
      panel, header over panel, panel over tab strip) is a stated L\* distance
      rather than an eyeballed one;
    - primary text meets **WCAG AA at 7:1** on the panel surface and secondary
      text meets **4.5:1** — `TextDisabled` carries real secondary content here
      (hints, derived readouts, command hints), so it is held to the text bar,
      not to the disabled-text exemption;
    - the accent is one hue used at several lightnesses/alphas, warm against the
      neutral ground so accented marks advance;
    - the semantic triad (axis X/Y/Z, and any future danger/success/info) is
      **equiluminant within ~2 L\***, so no member visually outranks the others,
      and each carries its label at ≥ 4.5:1.
  - **(added 2026-08-16, revision 4)** the shell states **elevation**, not just
    separation: the ribbon and the docked panels read as plates above the drawing
    canvas. A flat palette has no bevels to lean on, so this is carried by two
    paired marks — a lit edge along the top of a raised plate, and a soft shadow
    that plate casts onto the surface below it, landing **on the receiving
    surface** (the drawing canvas), not in the gap between them. Light comes from
    the top-left, matching the direction the classic theme's 3D bevels already
    imply, so the two themes never disagree about where the light is.
  - **(added 2026-08-16, revision 6)** inside a window, a **boxed or scrolling
    region sits on its own tone**, one step below the window it is cut into, so a
    scroll box reads as a well rather than as more window; and a **tab bar has a
    strip behind it**, so unselected tabs sit on that strip and the selected one
    stands on the body it belongs to. A child used purely to group layout is
    exempt and stays on the window tone — nesting two inset tones defeats both.
  - **(added 2026-08-16, revision 5)** a **floating window** — dialog, modal or
    popup — reads as lifted off the shell rather than pasted onto it. It carries
    a soft drop shadow on all sides, a lit top edge, and a title bar that is
    visibly live when the window holds focus. This applies to **every** floating
    window without each one opting in, so a dialog added later is covered the day
    it is written; a theme opts out by setting no window shadow.
- Owner-layer: UI (`src/ui/CadUi.cpp`)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-16)
- Revisions: 2026-08-16 — initial. Resolved as a SPEC GAP: both shipped themes
  (`ApplyCadDarkTheme`, `ApplyCadLightTheme`) were written with no governing
  requirement, and the `ImDrawList` chrome was hard-coded to the classic theme's
  colours regardless of which theme was active. User supplied the Hazel editor as
  the visual reference and chose (1) the **Dark** theme as the one to restyle,
  leaving the classic theme intact, and (2) full parity including the
  property-grid widgets. See ADR-033.
  2026-08-16 (revision 2) — after seeing revision 1 running, the user asked that
  the palette be put on a proper footing rather than left as hand-picked values.
  Measuring the shipped ramp found three defects the eye had registered but not
  named: the border (L\* 6.3) and the tab strip (L\* 6.8) were **0.5 L\* apart**,
  so panel outlines were invisible where they mattered most; the four darkest
  tones spanned 5 L\* while the three lightest spanned 16, which is what read as
  flat in places and abrupt in others; `TextDisabled` sat at **3.93:1**, below
  AA, while carrying real secondary content; and the axis triad spanned **13.6
  L\*** (green at 56.4 vs red at 42.8), so the Y badge visually outranked the
  others and its letter contrast was only 3.0:1. The added acceptance conditions
  above state the rules those defects broke. No ADR — values only; the mechanism
  is unchanged from ADR-033.
  2026-08-16 (revision 3) — the user reviewed revision 2 and asked for **true
  neutral** rather than its slight cool cast, resolving TASK-059's ASSUMPTION-1
  against it. Clause 1 is amended from "one hue at low saturation" to
  "achromatic", and the accent clause drops "near the neutrals' complement"
  (a complement is undefined against a hueless ground). Each neutral was replaced
  by the achromatic gray of **identical luminance**, so the L\* ladder, every
  structural distance and every contrast ratio carry over unchanged — maximum
  drift 0.14 L\*. Recorded because it makes the palette's one remaining chromatic
  claim stronger, not weaker: with no cast on any surface, colour anywhere in the
  shell now means something.
  2026-08-16 (revision 4) — the user reported that the ribbon and the Properties
  panel did not read as *above* the drawing, only as differently coloured. Value
  contrast alone turned out not to carry elevation once the palette was neutral;
  it needs the directional pair (lit top edge + cast shadow). Added as an
  acceptance condition rather than as an implementation note because "which
  surface receives the shadow" is the part that is easy to get wrong and looks
  like nothing when it is — see TASK-060. Delivered alongside three layout
  corrections that are not colour and are logged there.
  2026-08-16 (revision 5) — the user asked that dialogs (settings, import points,
  attach PDF, edit points, the traverse editor, the save-before-close prompt)
  stand out. The cause was structural rather than per-dialog: a floating window's
  fill is the *same* tone as the docked panel it covers, so nothing marked where
  one ended and the other began. Stated as a property of floating windows in
  general — not of the named dialogs — because a per-dialog fix would have to be
  repeated for every dialog written afterwards and would be forgotten. See
  TASK-061.
  2026-09-01 (revision 7) — GitHub issue #183 asked that dialogs read with the
  same depth as the Start screen tab: a top/bottom gradient on the window body,
  and primary/secondary buttons rendered as 3D bevelled buttons (gradient face,
  lit top-left edge, dark bottom-right edge, sunken pressed state) rather than
  flat rectangles. The issue flagged its own SPEC GAP — this is new outward-
  facing appearance, and the **Dark** theme's flat button face is a deliberate
  choice from ADR-033, not an oversight, so a blanket "add bevels everywhere"
  would have silently reversed it. Put to the user before any code (D-2026-09-
  01-a): **both the Dark and Light themes gain the gradient/bevel treatment, but
  only on floating DIALOGS** — Options, Layer Manager, Viewpoints, Import
  points, Export points, PDF Attach to start, tracked as a checklist for the
  rest (`BeginStyledDialog()`'s doc comment in `CadUi.hpp`). Docked panels, the
  ribbon, and popups/tooltips/menus are unchanged — they keep the flat/bevel
  treatment revisions 1–6 already settled for them. Acceptance:
  - a styled dialog's body carries a visible top-lighter/bottom-darker
    gradient, one ladder step each way from its theme's own panel surface —
    not applied to any docked panel, ribbon element or popup;
  - a primary action button (OK/Import/Apply/Add layer/Save/Load/Export/Attach)
    in a styled dialog renders as a raised 3D button: gradient face, a light
    top-left bevel and a dark bottom-right bevel, both bevels swapping sides on
    press so the button reads as sinking in;
  - a secondary button (Cancel, Help) in a styled dialog keeps the existing
    ribbon-bevel treatment (flat face, same swap-on-press bevel) rather than
    gaining a new gradient — the "quieter version" the issue asked for, with no
    new colours needed for it;
  - every new colour is a `g_chrome` field, filled for both Dark and Light, and
    a Dark → Light → Dark switch leaves no stale dialog/button colour.
  Delivered against a live user visual pass, which pulled in three corrections
  on the same requirement (all Dark-theme only — the classic theme still renders
  as it did):
  - a styled dialog's **tab bar** reads as tabs, not a flat strip: the
    unselected tab sits a full ladder step (`seam`) below the active one, which
    still merges into the body it belongs to;
  - a **bare description paragraph** at the top of a dialog tab is boxed like
    every other section (it no longer floats on the gradient body), and wraps
    to its own width so it is never clipped;
  - the surface dialogs' **property grids** are a white "paper" sheet — light
    rows, white bordered edit fields, dark body text, dark caret — with the
    dark header strip and its light labels kept; the old hard-coded pale-yellow
    Civil-3D row fill (which ignored the theme entirely) is gone.
  See TASK-165 for the one issue clause ("one shared helper used by both the
  Start screen and the dialogs") this revision does not fully satisfy, and why.

### REQ-082 — Tabular data windows behave like a spreadsheet
- Purpose: the Viewpoints and Layer Manager windows are the two places a surveyor
  reads and edits many rows at once; a form that happens to be laid out in
  columns is not usable at that scale
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A window whose content is a table of records — today the **survey
  points grid** (VIEWPOINTS) and the **Layer Manager** — behaves as a data grid,
  not as a stack of form controls:
  - **column sort**, ascending/descending by clicking a header, on every column
    whose value has an order (multi-column sort where the table supports it).
    Sorting reorders the **view only**; the underlying record order is unchanged;
  - **resizable, reorderable and hideable** columns;
  - the **header row stays visible** while the rows scroll;
  - a cell's editor **fills its cell** and carries no frame of its own at rest —
    the grid's own rules and row banding supply the structure — while remaining
    fully editable, with the frame appearing on hover and while editing;
  - **row height is uniform** and set by one line of text;
  - a toggle cell (checkbox, radio) is **centred and visible in both states**.
- Acceptance:
  - clicking a sortable header reorders the displayed rows and marks that column;
    clicking again reverses it;
  - rows with equal keys keep a stable, non-flickering order between frames;
  - after sorting, editing a row edits the record shown in that row, and deleting
    a row deletes the record shown in that row — i.e. the view order never
    rewires which record a control acts on;
  - scrolling the rows leaves the header in place;
  - an unchecked checkbox is visible;
  - the record order saved to file is unaffected by any display sort.
- Owner-layer: UI (`src/ui/CadUi.cpp`)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-16)
- Revisions: 2026-08-16 — initial. Raised by the user asking that these two
  windows "behave more like a spreadsheet, like Google Sheets". Recorded as its
  own requirement rather than as another REQ-081 revision because sorting and
  column state are **behaviour a user relies on**, not appearance — and because
  the third acceptance condition (view order must not rewire which record a
  control acts on) is the one that makes this safe to build and belongs in the
  spec rather than in a comment. See TASK-062.

### REQ-083 — `.txt` and `.csv` are interchangeable point-file extensions
- Purpose: point files leave data collectors and office packages with either
  extension for identical comma-delimited content; the surveyor should not have
  to defeat a file filter to import their own data (serves the import goal;
  REQ-201 — the tool must not make a file look absent when it is present)
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Import points and Export points treat **`.csv` and `.txt` as two
  spellings of one format** — the comma-delimited point file already defined by
  the layout combo (`P,N,E,Z,D` / `P,E,N,Z,D` / `N,E,Z` / `E,N,Z`). Concretely:
  - the Import points chooser offers `.csv` **and** `.txt` under one default
    filter, with `.csv`-only, `.txt`-only and *All* still selectable;
  - the Export points chooser offers the same list, and a typed name **already
    ending in `.csv` or `.txt` is written as typed** — only a name carrying
    neither gets a default extension appended;
  - **the extension carries no meaning.** Parsing and writing are decided by the
    layout and the header-row setting alone; byte-identical content imports to
    identical points and exports to identical bytes under either extension.
  - **No delimiter is inferred.** A `.txt` delimited by tabs or spaces is *not*
    silently accepted: it fails per row with the existing column diagnostic and
    writes nothing into the model (REQ-001). Sniffing a delimiter would let one
    ambiguous line decide how a whole file is read, which is the failure mode
    REQ-001 exists to prevent; a delimiter *choice* is a separate requirement if
    it is ever wanted.
  - REQ-041's validation — file not found / empty / locked, duplicate IDs within
    the file and against the session, per-row parse errors, the overall status
    line, Import disabled on a file-level problem, and the confirm-skip prompt —
    applies to a `.txt` exactly as it does to a `.csv`, with no second code path.
- Acceptance:
  - the Import points chooser lists `.txt` files with its **default** filter
    selected, and picking one populates the path;
  - the same comma-delimited bytes saved as `points.csv` and as `points.txt`
    import to identical points (ID, northing, easting, elevation, description)
    and produce an identical validation summary;
  - a missing, empty, or locked `.txt` shows its REQ-041 message and Import is
    disabled — the same message the `.csv` of that state shows;
  - a space- or tab-delimited `.txt` reports the per-row column error and adds no
    point to the drawing;
  - in Export points, a typed name with no extension is saved with the chosen
    filter's extension, and a name typed as `points.txt` is saved as
    `points.txt` — not `points.txt.csv`; both files' bytes are identical for the
    same drawing and layout.
- Owner-layer: Platform (the two file choosers), UI (wording), IO (unchanged —
  named here because it is the layer this requirement forbids from branching)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-17)
- Revisions: 2026-08-17 — initial. Raised by the user asking for `.txt` import
  "alongside" `.csv`. Two questions were answered before drafting: parsing stays
  **comma-only** (delimiter auto-detection was offered and declined), and the
  change covers **export as well as import**.

### REQ-084 — Right-click is customizable, and the shortcut menu is the drawing's action menu
- Purpose: right-click is the most-pressed button in a drafting session, and today
  GoSurvey spends it badly. The three context modes exist (REQ-054) but are buried in
  a collapsing header as three unlabelled combo boxes, so nobody finds them; and the
  menu they select is a bare list of five modify commands, so choosing "Shortcut Menu"
  trades a working ENTER for very little. Both halves are fixed together because
  neither is worth much alone: a discoverable dialog that still opens a thin menu has
  nothing to offer, and a rich menu nobody can reach is the state we are already in.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement:

  **(a) The Right-Click Customization dialog.** Options → User Preferences carries a
  **Right-click Customization…** button that opens a dialog of that name, laid out as
  AutoCAD's is and owning every right-click preference:
  - a **Turn on time-sensitive right-click** checkbox, with the rule it implies stated
    under it (quick click = ENTER, longer click = shortcut menu) and a **Longer click
    duration** field in **milliseconds**;
  - three labelled groups of **radio buttons** — not combo boxes — each carrying the
    sentence that says when it applies: **Default Mode** ("If no objects are selected,
    right-click means") = Repeat Last Command | Shortcut Menu; **Edit Mode** ("If one
    or more objects are selected") = Repeat Last Command | Shortcut Menu; **Command
    Mode** ("If a command is in progress") = ENTER | Shortcut Menu: always enabled |
    Shortcut Menu: enabled when command options are present;
  - **Apply & Close**, **Cancel** and **Help** buttons. Apply & Close writes the
    preferences to the user profile; **Cancel restores every value the dialog opened
    with**, including the checkbox and the duration.

  **Time-sensitive right-click is off by default**, so an existing profile's
  right-click behaviour does not change on upgrade. While it is **on**, Default Mode
  and Command Mode are **disabled** — the timer, not the preference, decides those two
  contexts — and this is shown by greying them, never by silently ignoring them
  (REQ-201). Edit Mode stays live, because a selection still chooses between repeating
  and the menu.

  **(b) What time-sensitive right-click does.** With it on, a right-click in the
  drawing is classified by **how long the button is held**: released within the
  configured duration it is an **ENTER** (the Command Mode ENTER path, and a repeat of
  the last command when idle); held past the duration it opens the **shortcut menu**,
  at the point of press. The menu therefore opens on release-or-elapse rather than on
  press — that is inherent to the feature, not a defect. With it **off**, right-click
  is classified on press exactly as it is today.

  **(c) The shortcut menu.** With no command running, right-click's shortcut menu is
  the drawing's action menu, in this order:
  - **Repeat LAST** — named for the last command, absent when there is none;
  - **Recent Input** (submenu) — the commands most recently entered, newest first;
    choosing one runs it. This is the same history the command bar's dropdown shows
    (REQ-040), so the two can never disagree;
  - **Isolate Objects** (submenu) — Isolate Objects | Hide Objects | End Object
    Isolation (see (d));
  - **Clipboard** (submenu) — Cut | Copy | Paste, with Cut/Copy disabled on an empty
    selection;
  - **Basic Modify Tools** (submenu) — Move | Copy Selection | Rotate | Scale | Erase |
    Offset | Trim | Join, disabled as a group when nothing is selected;
  - **Pan**, **Zoom**, **Free Orbit** — the view commands;
  - **Quick Select…** and **Options…**.

  **Find… is deliberately absent.** GoSurvey's find/replace searches only the MTEXT buffer being
  edited, and the drawing shortcut menu cannot open while that editor is up; there is no
  drawing-wide FIND. The item would therefore be a control that does nothing, which REQ-201
  forbids. It belongs to a drawing-wide FIND requirement, not to this menu.

  With a **selection**, the modify commands and the REQ-054 selection items (Select
  similar, Selection…, Clear selection) stay reachable as they are today. With a
  **command running**, the menu remains the short Command-Mode menu (Enter / Cancel) —
  a half-finished LINE is not the moment to offer Options.

  **(d) Object isolation.** **Isolate Objects** hides everything except the selection;
  **Hide Objects** hides the selection; **End Object Isolation** restores everything. A
  hidden object is hidden **and unpickable** — it must not be draggable, box-
  selectable, or hoverable while invisible, because an invisible object that still
  answers a click is worse than one that is simply drawn. Isolation is keyed on the
  **stable entity id** (REQ-076), never an array index, so an edit that compacts the
  arrays cannot silently isolate a different object. Isolation is **session state**: it
  is not written to `.gs`, and opening a drawing always shows all of it. It covers the
  entity types that carry `EntityAttributes` — lines, circles, arcs, ellipses,
  polylines, annotations, filled regions and meshes. Survey points and PDF underlays
  are out of scope for this requirement, and the command says so when it skips them.

  **Display Order is deliberately not in this menu.** It needs a persisted per-entity
  ordering key threaded through render, `.gs` and DXF, which is a separate requirement,
  not a menu item.
- Acceptance:
  - Options → User Preferences shows **Right-click Customization…**, and it opens a
    dialog with the checkbox, the millisecond field and the three radio groups;
  - ticking the checkbox greys Default Mode and Command Mode and leaves Edit Mode
    usable; unticking restores all three;
  - changing values and pressing **Cancel** leaves every preference at what it was when
    the dialog opened; pressing **Apply & Close** and restarting the app reproduces the
    chosen values — including the checkbox and the duration;
  - with time-sensitive **on** at 250 ms: a quick right-click during LINE ends the
    command as ENTER does, and a held right-click opens the shortcut menu instead;
  - with time-sensitive **off**, right-click behaves exactly as it did before this
    requirement, for all three modes;
  - the idle shortcut menu shows Repeat / Recent Input / Isolate Objects / Clipboard /
    Basic Modify Tools / Pan / Zoom / Free Orbit / Quick Select / Options; **Recent
    Input** lists the commands just typed, newest first, and picking one runs it;
  - **every** item in the menu does something when chosen — no entry is present that
    cannot act (REQ-201);
  - select two lines, **Isolate Objects** — the rest of the drawing disappears, a
    box-select drag across where it was selects nothing, and hovering there highlights
    nothing; **End Object Isolation** brings it all back;
  - **Hide Objects** on a selection hides exactly that selection;
  - saving a drawing with objects isolated and reopening it shows every object.
- Owner-layer: UI (the dialog, the shortcut menu, the click-timing classification) /
  Commands (isolation state, the isolate/hide/end commands, the pick gates, ORBIT) /
  Render (the draw gates) / IO (`UserPrefs` for the two new preferences)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-18)
- Revisions: 2026-08-18 — initial. Raised by the user with reference screenshots of
  AutoCAD's Right-Click Customization dialog and its drawing shortcut menu. Two
  questions were answered before drafting: **Display Order** was offered and
  deliberately deferred (it is a data-format change, not a menu item), and
  time-sensitive right-click ships **off** by default so no existing profile changes
  behaviour on upgrade. Supersedes REQ-054's Settings surface for these preferences —
  REQ-054's Edit Mode default and its selection menu items are unchanged.
  2026-08-18 — revised during implementation: **Find… dropped from the menu.** The
  reference screenshot carries it, but GoSurvey has no drawing-wide FIND and the
  existing find/replace is reachable only from inside the MTEXT editor, so the item
  would have been inert. Stated above rather than shipped as a dead control (REQ-201),
  and an acceptance condition added that no menu entry may be present that cannot act.

### REQ-085 — 3D polyline
- Purpose:     draw a linework string whose vertices each carry their own elevation, which is what a
               breakline or a feature line is made of
- Priority:    should
- Type:        functional
- Statement:   A `3DPOLY` command draws a polyline in which **every vertex has its own elevation**,
               entered per vertex rather than taken from the ELEV work plane. An object snap
               supplies the snapped point's Z (REQ-058, already the rule); with no snap the vertex
               elevation may be typed. The result is an ordinary polyline in the existing store —
               `userPolylineVerts` is already stride-3 XYZ — so it selects, moves, snaps, persists,
               and may be designated a breakline (REQ-069) exactly as any polyline does.
- Acceptance:
  - a `3DPOLY` drawn with three vertices at three different typed elevations stores three different
    Z values, and a `.gs` round trip preserves each;
  - snapping a vertex to a survey point gives that vertex the point's elevation, with ELEV set to
    an unrelated value;
  - the result is accepted by `DESIGNATEBREAKLINE` and the surface honours its per-vertex elevations;
  - the ordinary `POLYLINE` command is unchanged.
- Owner-layer: Commands, UI
- Status:      accepted (2026-08-19)
- Revisions:   2026-08-19 — initial. Raised when the surface workflow was revisited: breaklines were
               being drawn with `POLYLINE`, which commits every vertex at the ELEV plane unless the
               user happens to snap, so a breakline drawn free-hand silently tore the surface down
               to elevation 0 along its length.
               2026-08-19 — accepted and implemented (TASK-075). One acceptance condition is NOT
               covered by an automated test and is recorded as such rather than claimed: snapping a
               vertex to a survey point cannot be driven headlessly, because `viewportSnapPickValid`
               is set by the UI hover path the REQ-203 driver has no equivalent of. The code path is
               shared with POLYLINE (`CadCommitElevation`), which REQ-058 already covers.

### REQ-086 — A point file as a surface data source
- Purpose:     build a surface directly from a delivered point file, without importing thousands of
               points into the drawing first
- Priority:    should
- Type:        functional
- Statement:   A surface's definition may reference **point files** by path alongside its point
               groups (REQ-069). A linked file is re-read on rebuild, so editing the file changes
               the surface, and its points feed the triangulation **without becoming drawing survey
               points**. A linked file may be **imported into the drawing** instead, which reads it
               once through the REQ-083 import path, creates survey points and a point group, and
               breaks the link. A path that no longer resolves is reported and the surface keeps its
               last good triangulation (REQ-001), rather than silently shrinking.
- Acceptance:
  - a surface built from a linked file has the file's points in its triangulation and the drawing's
    survey point count is unchanged;
  - editing the file and rebuilding changes the triangle count;
  - breaking the link creates survey points and a point group, and the surface still builds
    identically afterwards;
  - a missing file is named in the log, the surface is marked not-current, and the previous
    triangulation is retained;
  - a `.gs` round trip preserves the link, and a legacy `.gs` with no such array loads unchanged.
- Owner-layer: Domain, IO, UI
- Status:      accepted (2026-08-19)
- Revisions:   2026-08-19 — initial. The file is read during the UI-thread resolve step
               (`ResolveSurfaceInputs`), never on the rebuild worker, so REQ-069's worker stays pure
               and touches no `AppCommandState` and no filesystem (architecture §8 rule 1).
               2026-08-19 — accepted and implemented (TASK-076). The link stores the column LAYOUT
               alongside the path, which the statement above did not say: a point file does not
               describe its own column order, and a link that re-guessed would swap northing for
               easting on reload. Also added during implementation: breaking the link is REFUSED
               when the import brought in no points (REQ-083 skips rows whose point id already
               exists), because dropping the link would then silently delete the file.s whole
               contribution — the link is the only thing still supplying those points.

### REQ-087 — Feature line entity
- Purpose:     a named 3D linework object that grading is designed with and that a surface can
               consume as a breakline — the object a designer edits, as opposed to survey linework
- Priority:    should
- Type:        functional
- Statement:   A **feature line** is a first-class drawing entity: an ordered chain of points each
               with an elevation, carrying a name and a description. It may be created by drawing it
               (`FEATURELINE`), or converted from existing lines, polylines, arcs or 3D polylines
               (`FEATURELINESFROMOBJECTS`), which may optionally erase the source. Its geometry is
               editable — insert and delete a PI — and it may be **added to a surface as a
               breakline**, after which the surface tracks it dynamically like any other breakline
               (REQ-069). It selects, moves, snaps, hides by layer, persists to `.gs`, and is
               undoable in one step per operation, like every other entity (REQ-076 identity).
- Acceptance:
  - a feature line drawn with per-vertex elevations survives a `.gs` round trip byte-identically;
  - converting a closed polyline yields a closed feature line with the same vertices;
  - inserting a PI adds a vertex without changing the elevation of the existing ones;
  - adding a feature line to a surface forces triangulation edges along it, and moving the feature
    line rebuilds the surface with no user action;
  - deleting the feature line removes it from the surface's definition (REQ-069's rule);
  - a legacy `.gs` with no feature lines loads unchanged.
- Owner-layer: Domain, IO, Renderer, UI, Commands
- Status:      proposed
- Revisions:   2026-08-19 — initial. Reverses ADR-028 alternative (5), which deferred feature lines
               as "a separate milestone once surfaces are trustworthy"; this is that milestone.
               2026-08-20 — TASK-079 landed the "moves" clause: MOVE, COPY, ROTATE and SCALE, with
               previews and a selection highlight, and explicit refusals from TRIM, OFFSET, JOIN
               and COPYCLIP. Status stays `proposed`: "snaps" is not built (stage 2b owes snap,
               grips, DXF and PDF plot), and until it is, the Statement above describes more than
               the code does.
               2026-08-20 — TASK-082: FEATURELINE is drawable with the mouse. A click places X,Y
               and the command prompts for the elevation (default: the previous point's). Fixes
               a defect that made the command mouse-inoperable — K::FeatureLine was absent from
               both viewport-click routing lists, so every click was silently discarded — and
               adds the rubber-band preview the draft never had.

### REQ-088 — Feature line elevation editing
- Purpose:     set and check grade along a feature line, which is the actual work of grading design
- Priority:    should
- Type:        functional
- Statement:   A feature line's elevations are editable through a table showing, per point:
               **station, elevation, length to the next point, grade back and grade ahead**. Editing
               an elevation updates the adjacent grades; editing a grade updates the downstream
               elevations. Points may be raised or lowered as a set by a delta. A feature line
               additionally supports **elevation points** — points that carry an elevation but are
               not geometry vertices, insertable and deletable independently of PIs.
- Acceptance:
  - typing an elevation updates grade back and grade ahead on the neighbouring rows and nowhere else;
  - typing a grade ahead moves the next point's elevation and leaves the current one alone;
  - stations and lengths agree with the feature line's plan geometry to REQ-101's tolerance;
  - an elevation point changes the surface when the feature line is used as a breakline, and does
    not add a plan vertex;
  - every edit is undoable in one step and the surface rebuilds with no user action.
- Owner-layer: UI, Domain
- Status:      accepted
- Revisions:   2026-08-19 — initial.
               2026-08-20 — TASK-080 stage 1: the derived table and the six edits, driven by
               FLELEV. Four of five acceptance conditions verified headlessly; "rebuilds with no
               user action" is verified up to the frame tick the REQ-203 driver does not have.
               Also unblocked REQ-087's breakline clause — ResolveDefinitionChain had no
               FeatureLine branch, so a feature line designated as a breakline resolved as ABSENT
               and was stripped from the surface definition on the next rebuild. Status stays
               `proposed`: the Statement says "editable through a TABLE", and stage 2 is what puts
               one on screen.
               2026-08-20 — TASK-081 stage 2: the Feature Line Elevations panel. Every cell edit
               runs an FLELEV command, so the panel and the REQ-203 driver exercise one code
               path. ACCEPTED. The panel's own rendering has no automated coverage and cannot
               while the driver has no window; that is mitigated by the routing, not solved.

### REQ-161 — Developer Shell (Debug-only chrome tuner, activity log, GUI driver)
- Purpose: let developers tune ImGui chrome live, see what the GUI and command path are doing, and
           drive the **real** ImGui UI from code — without shipping any of that in Release
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A **Developer Shell** exists only when CMake option `GOSURVEY_DEVELOPER_SHELL` is ON.
  That option **defaults ON** if and only if `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is `Debug`, and is **forced OFF**
  for Release (and for any configuration that builds the shipped installer). It is a compile-time
  gate, not a runtime hide.

  When ON, the windowed `GoSurvey` binary:

  - shows a Developer Shell (dockable ImGui window): **chrome tuner** that writes the existing
    ADR-033 `UiChrome` instance and relevant `ImGuiStyle` metrics so padding, sizes, and chrome
    colours change **this frame** with no rebuild;
  - shows an **activity log** of discrete events: ribbon/tool/item activations, Test Engine
    injected mouse/key, viewport **picks/clicks** (not GL draw calls), command-line input and
    output / log lines;
  - links **Dear ImGui Test Engine** (`imgui_test_engine/`, FetchContent, GIT_TAG pinned — REQ-200)
    and compiles ImGui **for this executable only** with `IMGUI_ENABLE_TEST_ENGINE`. Registered
    tests and a Debug-only CLI (`--devshell-run <test_name>`) queue and run those tests against
    the live UI (full GUI driver).

  When OFF (Release): `src/devshell/` is not a source of `GoSurvey`; Test Engine is not fetched
  into that target's link line; `IMGUI_ENABLE_TEST_ENGINE` is not defined on any ImGui objects
  that executable links; there is no Developer Shell menu/window.

  **REQ-203 is unchanged:** `gosurvey_headless` never links Test Engine, never defines
  `IMGUI_ENABLE_TEST_ENGINE`, and never includes `src/devshell/`. Domain/headless keep measuring
  fonts through ImGui **core without** Test Engine hooks.

  Activity logging must not run on the REQ-100 measured hot path as an unbounded per-primitive
  stream. A one-line-per-frame “draw submitted” toggle may exist in the Shell, default **off**.
- Acceptance:
  - `ninja-release` `GoSurvey.exe`: `dumpbin /SYMBOLS` (or `/DEPENDENTS` plus strings) shows **no**
    `ImGuiTestEngine`, **no** `DevShell`, **no** `GOSURVEY_DEVELOPER_SHELL` as a live feature —
    proven by a ctest that fails if those symbols are present;
  - `ninja-debug` with the option ON: Developer Shell is reachable; moving a chrome tuner control
    changes on-screen chrome the same session;
  - a Debug Test Engine script performs a ribbon/tool activation, a viewport click (or item click
    that issues a pick), and command-line in/out; each appears as a **distinct log line**;
  - `--devshell-run` of that script exits 0 with drawing/command state matching the same steps
    done by hand (entity counts / command log), without requiring a human at the mouse;
  - Release behaviour with the Shell absent matches today's app (commands, viewport, chrome).
- Owner-layer: Application (flag, `main` wiring), UI (`src/devshell/`, chrome accessors), Build
- Status: accepted (2026-08-29)
- Revisions: 2026-08-29 — initial. D-2026-08-29-f, ADR-040. Amends the 2026-08-16 GUI-automation
  anti-requirement for **Debug only**.

### REQ-170 — LibreDWG is the DXF and DWG codec
- Purpose: File Format Specs — open and save DWG/DXF in-process with no ODA/AutoCAD converter on
  the customer machine; write DWG only as far as LibreDWG is trustworthy (R2004)
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: **GNU LibreDWG** is the codec for `.dwg` and `.dxf` (ADR-041). GoSurvey links it and
  is therefore **GPL-3.0-or-later**.
  **Open:** a DWG or DXF opens without `FindDwgConverter` for the happy path. Version is reported
  by release name (existing probe may remain). A file that is not DWG/DXF is refused with that
  reason (REQ-001). Entities and tables LibreDWG decoded are mapped into the GoSurvey domain;
  every skipped class, exploded INSERT (until REQ-107), extra layout, and proxy is **named in the
  log** (REQ-201). State-plane coordinates obey REQ-101 (origin subtract in double before float).
  **Save DWG:** only **R2000** or **R2004**; default **R2004**. R2007+ is refused. The file AutoCAD
  opens must do so **without a Recover prompt** for the entity set we emit. Before overwrite, the
  UI lists what this down-convert / domain mapping will drop. Failed write leaves the destination
  untouched.
  **Save DXF:** LibreDWG’s DXF writer; binary DXF is included to the extent the library writes it
  (this **subsumes** proposed REQ-112 when implemented). Types with no representation (TIN, mesh,
  cloud, PDF) are logged exclusions, not silent drops.
  Phase 1 converter-based Import/Export remains until these acceptance conditions are met, then is
  removed from the user-facing path (oracle use is allowed).
- Acceptance:
  - an R2018 `.dwg` opens with **no** ODA File Converter and **no** AutoCAD installed in the test
    environment, and model-space LINE/CIRCLE/LWPOLYLINE/TEXT/MTEXT/HATCH that LibreDWG decoded
    appear in the drawing;
  - a non-DWG renamed to `.dwg` is refused and the document is unchanged;
  - File ▸ Export DWG (default) writes R2004; AutoCAD or ODA File Converter (oracle) opens it
    **without Recover** and the emitted entity counts match the log;
  - exporting R2018 is refused by name; the destination file is not created;
  - a failed encode does not truncate an existing destination;
  - `GoSurvey` / installer materials state GPL-3.0-or-later.
- Owner-layer: IO (codec), Domain (mapping), UI (lossy-save list), Build (link LibreDWG, MSVC)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-29 — File Format Specs (D-2026-08-29-g, ADR-041). Does not replace REQ-052
  Phase 1 until this requirement is verified.

### REQ-171 — Point cloud entity
- Purpose: File Format Specs — hold laser-scan points without pretending they are a TIN (REQ-068)
  or a triangle mesh (REQ-063)
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A drawing may contain **point cloud** objects (ADR-042): reference geometry with a
  `shared_ptr<const>` payload (§11.5), interleaved XYZ, optional RGB and intensity. They are
  visible, selectable, erasable, layer-controlled, and included in extents. They are **not**
  grip-edited, not written to DXF/DWG in this epic, and **not** surface definition sources.
  `.gs` persists them additively. Erase + undo is one step. Legacy `.gs` without the section
  loads unchanged.
- Acceptance:
  - a cloud appears in the viewport, selects as one object, and erase/undo restores it;
  - extents include the cloud; freeze/off/non-plottable on its layer hides it;
  - an unrelated line edit does **not** deep-copy the payload (shared immutable pointer);
  - DXF/DWG export **names** the cloud exclusion in the log;
  - a pre-REQ-171 `.gs` still opens.
- Owner-layer: Domain/Renderer/IO
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-29 — D-2026-08-29-g, ADR-042.

### REQ-172 — E57, LAS, LAZ, PTS, and PTX interchange
- Purpose: File Format Specs — the open scan formats consultants actually send
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: GoSurvey **imports and exports** ASTM **E57**, ASPRS **LAS**, **LAZ** (LASzip),
  Cyclone-style **PTS**, and **PTX** (ADR-042, `spec/file-format-specs.md` §3.2). Import creates
  REQ-171 cloud(s). Export writes the selected cloud(s) (or all, when none selected — stated in
  the command). PTS/PTX parsers are in-tree; no delimiter auto-detect. PTX setup transforms are
  applied so points land in world coordinates within REQ-101. Malformed files refuse and leave
  the drawing unchanged (REQ-001).
- Acceptance:
  - a known-good PTS of N points imports N points (count in the log) at coordinates within
    REQ-101 of the file;
  - export of that cloud to PTS, then re-import, preserves count and XYZ within REQ-101;
  - the same for PTX **including** a non-identity setup transform (hand-checked 4×4);
  - a LAS and a LAZ of the same points import equal counts and XYZ within REQ-101;
  - an E57 with XYZ (+ RGB if present) imports; a truncated/malformed E57/LAS/PTS is refused
    with a specific message and no partial cloud;
  - missing file / empty path: no crash, drawing unchanged.
- Owner-layer: IO/Domain/UI
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-29 — D-2026-08-29-g. Delivery order: PTS → PTX → LAS → LAZ → E57
  (`spec/file-format-specs.md` §6).

### REQ-173 — Raster IMAGE underlays (JPEG, PNG, BMP)
- Purpose: File Format Specs — photos and scans on the sheet, like PDF attach, not a viewer app
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: JPEG, PNG, and BMP attach as **IMAGE** underlays (ADR-042): file path, insertion
  point, rotation, width/height in drawing units, layer. Decode uses the existing stb_image
  path. They plot if plottable. `.gs` stores the path and placement; a missing image on reload
  unloads that underlay and logs it, and the rest of the drawing still loads. IMAGE may be
  written to DXF/DWG when the LibreDWG mapping exists; until then the export log names the
  exclusion rather than dropping silently.
- Acceptance:
  - attach a PNG, place it, see it in model space; MOVE the underlay; undo restores;
  - freeze its layer hides it; `.gs` round-trip restores path and placement;
  - delete the file on disk, reopen `.gs`: drawing loads, IMAGE is unloaded, log says so;
  - a truncated PNG is refused and no underlay is added.
- Owner-layer: Domain/IO/Renderer/UI
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-29 — D-2026-08-29-g, ADR-042.

### REQ-174 — IFC view import (no write)
- Purpose: File Format Specs — see a building model as reference geometry
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: An **IFC** file imports as one or more **REQ-063 meshes** (ADR-042). GoSurvey does
  **not** write IFC, does not store an IFC graph, and does not decode Autodesk vertical objects
  inside DWG (ADR-026). The parser is IfcPlusPlus unless a later decision records a switch.
  Skipped/unsupported IFC products are listed in the log (REQ-201). Malformed IFC leaves the
  drawing unchanged (REQ-001). Meshes remain excluded from DXF/DWG export.
- Acceptance:
  - a small IFC2x3 or IFC4 fixture produces a mesh whose triangle count is logged and is > 0;
  - extents include the mesh; visual style Shaded occludes as REQ-064;
  - File ▸ Export IFC does not exist (or is disabled with “view only”);
  - a truncated IFC is refused; the drawing is unchanged;
  - DXF/DWG export logs the mesh exclusion.

### REQ-175 — DWG is the drawing document; GoSurvey state is preserved in the file
- Purpose: File → Open/Save and headless OPEN/SAVEAS treat DWG as the drawing, without dropping
  survey-specific data that today lives in `.gs`
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: The **drawing document** is a `.dwg`. File → Open, Save, and Save As default to DWG
  and do not list `.gs` as a drawing type. Headless `OPEN` and `SAVEAS` use DWG the same way.
  A GoSurvey save writes LibreDWG CAD entities (REQ-170) **and** embeds the existing GoSurvey
  JSON document (the same tree `.gs` writes) so survey points, traverse, layouts, text/surface
  styles, `worldDocumentOrigin`, and the rest of that tree survive Open → Save → Open.
  A DWG without that payload is a **foreign** drawing and imports through REQ-170 CAD mapping.
  `.gs` read/write remains in the tree (workspace template, explicit `.gs` paths, future
  project file) and is not the File drawing chooser. Existing `.gs` files still open when a
  path ending in `.gs` is given (command line, template, transcript `OPEN samples/…`).
  This does **not** claim unknown-object preservation (DM-08).
- Acceptance:
  - a new drawing, File → Save, writes a `.dwg` (not `.gs`);
  - File → Open’s default filter is DWG; `.gs` is not listed as a drawing type;
  - File → Save As defaults to `.dwg`; the file reopens in GoSurvey with CAD and survey state
    that were in the document at save;
  - opening an existing GoSurvey `.dwg` and Save updates that DWG, not a sidecar `.gs`;
  - a survey point (id, N/E/elev, description) survives Export DWG / Open DWG within REQ-101;
  - a foreign DWG with no GoSurvey payload still imports model-space LINE/CIRCLE as REQ-170;
  - `SaveGoSurveyFile` / `LoadGoSurveyFile` remain callable;
  - headless `SAVEAS`/`OPEN` of `%OUT%/*.dwg` round-trips that document.
- Owner-layer: IO (payload + LibreDWG), UI (dialogs), Commands/headless (OPEN/SAVEAS)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-29 — D-2026-08-29-j, ADR-044 (renumbered from D-2026-08-29-h / ADR-043 on the
  beta merge; those identifiers were taken by the REQ-107 block-editor decision).

### REQ-089 — Surface rollover readout
- Purpose:     the constant "what is this, and how high is it here" while working over a topo,
               answered without a click and without running a command
- Priority:    should
- Type:        functional
- Statement:   When the model-space cursor rests over a TIN surface — the plan position under the
               cursor lies **inside one of its triangles** — and has not moved for a **dwell
               period**, a readout appears beside the cursor naming the surface, its **effective
               style** (REQ-070 resolution), its **layer**, and the **interpolated elevation** at
               that plan position, using REQ-074's interpolation and REQ-101's tolerance. The
               readout covers **every visible surface** over that position — the overlapping
               existing-vs-proposed case REQ-074 already reports on — and is a **readout only**: it
               accepts no input and changes no state. It disappears on cursor movement, and never
               appears while a command is active, while a gesture is in progress, or in paper space.

               **The plan position is the one every other pick consumes** (the REQ-058 input seam),
               so under an orbited camera it is the cursor ray's intersection with the work plane
               rather than with the triangle under the pixel. That is deliberate: SURFELEV reads the
               same seam, so the two always agree about where "here" is. A ray-cast against the
               triangulation would be more faithful under a tilted camera and is a separate
               requirement, not an implementation detail of this one.
- Acceptance:
  - resting the cursor inside a surface for the dwell period shows the readout; moving the cursor
    hides it immediately and re-arms the dwell;
  - the elevation shown equals the planar interpolation at that position within REQ-101 — the same
    condition REQ-074 states, and the same query;
  - a position covered by no triangle — outside the border, in a concave notch, or inside a REQ-069
    hide-boundary void — shows **no readout**, and no elevation is extrapolated;
  - a surface whose style name is empty or no longer in the table reads its REQ-070 fallback style
    name, never blank;
  - a surface on an off or frozen layer, or isolated out under REQ-084 (d), produces no readout;
  - two overlapping visible surfaces produce one block each, both named;
  - **the per-frame cost of moving the cursor over a surface is unchanged**: the covering-surface
    query runs **once, when the dwell elapses**, and its result is latched — never re-run per frame.
    This is an acceptance condition rather than a note because `TinElevationAt` is a linear scan over
    every triangle and REQ-100 profile (c) is the one profile near budget and CPU-bound; a per-frame
    query would roughly double its dominant cost.
- Owner-layer: UI (dwell, gating, draw), Commands (the query)
- Status:      accepted
- Revisions:   2026-08-23 — initial. Requires no ADR: the state is UI-transient on
               `AppCommandState` beside the existing hover fields, the payload latches formatted
               text rather than a surface index (architecture §11.9), the dwell helper is a concrete
               free function in a pure header, and nothing is persisted.
               2026-08-23 — TASK-088 implemented it. The last acceptance condition (the query runs
               once per rest, never per frame) is **pinned by a test** — `HoverDwellTests`, 600
               frames of a held cursor, one query. The elevation, containment and style-fallback
               conditions are met by the calls the readout reuses, each already pinned by
               `TinQueryTests` / `SurfaceStyleTests`. The conditions about what appears **on screen**
               — the readout showing on dwell, hiding on movement, and being suppressed during a
               command — are implemented and reviewed but **not observed**: see TASK-088 FINDING-1,
               where synthetic input could not produce a hovered frame (a ribbon button used as a
               control did not highlight either). Status stays `accepted` rather than advancing to
               `implemented` until someone has watched it work.

### REQ-090 — Survey point rollover readout
- Purpose:     read a point's number and coordinates without clicking it or opening the point list —
               the same question REQ-089 answers for a surface, asked far more often
- Priority:    should
- Type:        functional
- Statement:   When the model-space cursor rests over a survey point's marker and has not moved for
               the REQ-089 dwell period, a readout appears beside the cursor giving the point
               **number**, its **layer**, and its **northing, easting and elevation**.

               **Northing and easting are reported in WORLD coordinates.** Survey points are stored
               local (`world = local + worldDocumentOrigin`, architecture §11 / `CadCoordinateFrame`),
               so the readout resolves through `CadCoord::WorldXFromLocal` / `WorldYFromLocal` at
               `surveyPointDisplayPrecision` — the same conversion and the same precision the
               Properties panel already applies to the same point. Elevation is absolute and is NOT
               rebased, because the local-storage rebase is X/Y-only.

               **A survey point takes precedence over a surface.** Where the cursor rests on a point
               that also lies inside a surface, the point's readout is shown and REQ-089's is not —
               the same priority the pick funnel already applies, and the alternative (stacking both
               blocks) would put a four-row panel between the user and the marker they are pointing
               at. It reuses REQ-089's dwell, suppression rules and panel; there is one readout
               beside the cursor, never two.
- Acceptance:
  - resting on a point marker for the dwell period shows the readout; moving the cursor hides it
    immediately and re-arms the dwell;
  - **northing and easting equal what the Properties panel shows for the same point, in a drawing
    whose `worldDocumentOrigin` is NON-ZERO** — a local/world mix-up is invisible on a test drawing
    near the origin and wrong by hundreds of thousands of feet on a real state-plane one, so the
    condition names the case that can actually fail;
  - elevation equals the point's stored elevation at `surveyPointDisplayPrecision`;
  - the number shown is `SurveyPoint::id`;
  - resting on a point that also lies inside a surface shows the point's readout and only that;
  - no readout appears while a command is active, while a gesture is in progress, or in paper space.
- Owner-layer: UI
- Status:      accepted
- Revisions:   2026-08-23 — initial. Widens the readout REQ-089 introduced, which
               D-2026-08-23-a (4) scoped to surfaces with "a later requirement can widen it if the
               readout proves useful". Requires no ADR for the same reasons REQ-089 did not, and one
               fewer: the hit test already exists and already runs every frame
               (`viewportHoverSurveyPointIndex`), so this adds no query at all.

### REQ-091 — User accounts and sign-in (Auth0)
- Purpose: identify a user for license/paid-tier enforcement, which anonymous REQ-080
  telemetry is deliberately unable to do
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: The application supports signing in via **Google**, **Microsoft**
  (Outlook/Live), or a self-registered **email + username + password** account, backed
  by Auth0 (a managed identity provider) rather than an in-house auth backend. Sign-in
  uses Auth0's hosted Universal Login page reached via the system browser — the
  application never renders its own password form or OAuth-provider buttons and never
  receives a raw password. The native app authenticates using the system-browser +
  loopback-redirect + PKCE flow (RFC 8252): no embedded webview. The resulting refresh
  token is stored via Windows Credential Manager, never in `gosurvey-user.json` or any
  other plaintext file; access/ID tokens are kept in memory only and are never
  persisted. On subsequent launches the application renews the session silently from
  the stored refresh token, without reopening the browser, unless that token has expired
  or been revoked, in which case interactive sign-in runs again. A signed-in user's
  identity is verified against Auth0's issued token; the application does not trust an
  unverified claim of identity from anywhere else.

  This requirement covers identity and the session-level sign-in gate. It does not gate
  any individual feature or command: the license/tier lookup (below) is a hook other
  requirements will consume once what is gated and under what terms is decided —
  inventing that scope here would be the spec guessing at business decisions it has no
  authority over. The gate below governs SESSION ACCESS, which is a different thing.

  **Launch gate (added 2026-08-23, D-2026-08-23-d, reverses this requirement's original
  "no application feature is gated" condition):** every launch, until the user is signed
  in, a modal window blocks the rest of the application — no drawing can be opened or
  started. It offers only Sign In; there is no dismiss, skip, or close. The one
  exception: when there is no internet connectivity at all, the gate is skipped entirely
  and the application opens normally, signed out — the same offline exception REQ-077's
  update-check gate uses, and for the same reason (a surveyor with no signal must not be
  locked out of a program that has nothing to reach). The gate is resolved once per
  launch and is not re-imposed if the user signs out later in the same session.
- Acceptance:
  - clicking "Sign In" opens the system browser to Auth0 Universal Login showing all
    three configured options: Google, Microsoft, and email/username/password;
  - completing sign-in by any of the three methods returns control to the application
    (the loopback redirect is caught) and the settings panel shows "Signed in as
    `<email>`";
  - closing and reopening the application does not require interactive sign-in again
    while the stored refresh token remains valid;
  - an expired or revoked refresh token causes the next launch to require interactive
    sign-in;
  - the refresh token never appears in `gosurvey-user.json` or any other plaintext file
    — verified by inspecting Windows Credential Manager rather than the prefs file;
  - no individual command or feature is separately gated or blocked by sign-in state or
    tier beyond the launch gate itself (mechanism only, per the scope note above);
  - REQ-080's anonymous telemetry ping is unchanged by this requirement;
  - **(added 2026-08-23)** on launch, with network reachable and no valid stored
    session, a modal blocks all other interaction until Sign In succeeds — no close
    button, no click-away dismissal;
  - **(added 2026-08-23)** on launch, with `HasInternetConnectivity()` reporting no
    route to the internet, the modal does not appear at all and the application opens
    normally;
  - **(added 2026-08-23)** signing out from the Settings panel later in the same
    session does not reopen the launch gate.
  - **(added 2026-09-01, D-2026-09-01-a, issue #182)** while signed in, a **Sign Out**
    control is available on the Start-screen "Connect" card and from a dropdown on the
    far-right menu-bar email; each performs the same sign-out as Settings ▸ Account;
  - **(added 2026-09-01)** the far-right menu-bar email opens a dropdown offering
    **Account Details** and **Sign Out**; nothing is shown there while signed out;
  - **(added 2026-09-01)** **Account Details** opens a small read-only window showing
    the signed-in email and a "more coming soon" note — no tier, no editable fields.
- Owner-layer: Platform (loopback listener, Credential Manager, connectivity check), Auth
  (pure logic, mirrors Telemetry's split), UI (sign-in entry point/status, launch gate)
- Status:      accepted
- Revisions:   2026-08-23 — initial (D-2026-08-23-c). See ADR-037 for the Auth0/PKCE/
               Credential-Manager technical shape and the REQ-300 dependency decision.
               2026-08-23 — added the blocking launch gate with an offline exception
               (D-2026-08-23-d), reversing the original "no application feature is
               gated" condition for session access specifically (not for individual
               features/tiers, which remain ungated).
               2026-09-01 — added Sign Out on the Start screen and a menu-bar account
               dropdown (Account Details + Sign Out) plus a read-only Account Details
               placeholder window (D-2026-09-01-a, GitHub issue #182). No new identity
               or sign-out mechanism; reuses existing request flags.

### REQ-092 — License-tier lookup endpoint
- Purpose: give the application a place to learn a signed-in user's entitlement, ahead
  of any requirement naming what that entitlement controls
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A backend endpoint, separate from the REQ-080 telemetry Worker, verifies
  the caller's Auth0-issued JWT and returns that user's license tier. New sign-ups
  default to a single tier (e.g. `"free"`); nothing yet writes any other value — billing,
  an admin tool, or a manual grant are explicitly future work, not part of this
  requirement.
- Acceptance:
  - a request with no JWT, an invalid JWT, or an expired JWT is rejected (401/403) and
    never reaches the tier lookup;
  - a request with a valid JWT for a newly signed-up user returns the default tier;
  - the endpoint's data store is separate from the telemetry Worker's, so a defect in
    one cannot read or corrupt the other's data.
- Owner-layer: Platform/backend (new Cloudflare Worker + D1 database, outside `src/`)
- Status:      accepted
- Revisions:   2026-08-23 — initial (D-2026-08-23-c). See ADR-037.

### REQ-102 — Layer state enforcement
- Purpose: Layer On/Freeze/Lock are stored and round-tripped but never enforced — every layer always draws, is always selectable, and is always editable
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Toggling a layer Off or Frozen hides its entities from the viewport and any plot; Frozen also excludes it from selection, snapping, and drawing extents; Locked entities stay visible and snappable but reject move/erase/grip/property edits.
- Acceptance (sketch): Off/Frozen layers don't render on screen or in a plot; Frozen layers are excluded from selection, snap and extents; Locked entities are visible/snappable but reject edits; unlocking/thawing restores prior behavior with no data loss; composes correctly with the existing per-viewport layer freeze (REQ-028).
- Owner-layer: Domain/Renderer/Commands/UI
- Status: proposed
- Revisions: 2026-08-23 — catalogued (D-2026-08-23-i)

### REQ-103 — Modify-command completeness
- Purpose: MIRROR, STRETCH, EXTEND, BREAK, FILLET, CHAMFER, ARRAY, EXPLODE, and LENGTHEN are all absent from the Modify toolset
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Add the nine commands above, each operating on the entity types they apply to today, undoable in one step, consistent with the existing MOVE/COPY/ROTATE/SCALE/TRIM/OFFSET pattern. Delivered incrementally, one command per task, in the sequence below — each independently shippable and independently verifiable, the same incremental-epic pattern as REQ-066…075/M-Surfaces.
- Sequence:
  1. **MIRROR** — closest existing precedent (ROTATE/SCALE's transform-funnel shape); no new entity kind; ships first.
  2. **LENGTHEN** — extends/shortens a line/arc/polyline along its own direction; its edge-parameter math is reused by EXTEND and FILLET below.
  3. **EXTEND** — TRIM's direct inverse; reuses TRIM's cutting-edge selection/hover infrastructure (REQ-056) almost entirely.
  4. **BREAK** — splits an entity at one or two picked points; contained, no new entity kind.
  5. **STRETCH** — crossing-window selection that only moves vertices inside the window; the one sub-item likely to need its own short design pass (crossing-vs-window selection doesn't exist yet).
  6. **FILLET / CHAMFER** — corner generation (arc or chamfer line) between two entities, trimming/extending them to meet it; follows EXTEND/TRIM naturally.
  7. **ARRAY** — rectangular + polar; N-copy repetition of the same duplication machinery MIRROR/COPY establish.
  8. **EXPLODE** — decomposes a closed polyline (including rectangles, which are 4-vertex polylines per REQ-053) into line segments; reports what it can't decompose (arcs, ellipses, mesh, surface, fills) rather than doing nothing silently (REQ-201).
- Acceptance — MIRROR (step 1, this increment):
  - a mirror line is specified by two points; text/mtext insertion points reflect across it, but glyphs stay upright and readable — no mirror-image flip (AutoCAD's MIRRTEXT=0 default; no MIRRTEXT-equivalent setting is added, this is fixed behavior for now);
  - after the mirror line, an "Erase source objects? [Yes/No] <N>" prompt appears, defaulting to **No** (source kept, mirrored copy added) — matching AutoCAD's own default;
  - erase=No: the mirrored result is a duplicate with newly assigned stable ids (REQ-076/ADR-027 — never a copied source id), the original selection is untouched; a duplicated survey point with an id conflict is resolved through the existing new-vs-offset modal (the same one COPY/rotate-copy already use), not silently;
  - erase=Yes: the duplicate commits, then the pre-mirror selection is removed — net result is only the reflected geometry;
  - `FilledRegion` (hatches), `Mesh`, `PdfUnderlay`, and `Surface` in the selection are excluded from the mirror with a logged reason (REQ-201) rather than silently dropped or mishandled — `FilledRegion`/`Surface` per the existing rotate/scale exclusion precedent (this file, REQ-042 fills note; `DropSurfacesFromSelectionForTransform`), `Mesh` because it is never edited (REQ-063), `PdfUnderlay` because its scalar rotation/scale fields cannot represent a reflection;
  - one undo step restores the exact pre-mirror state;
  - reachable from the Modify ribbon (button already exists, disabled, at `CadUi.cpp:2322`), by typed `MIRROR`, and by right-click repeat;
  - works with a selection made in model space, in a paper-space layout, and through a floating model-space viewport (parity with ROTATE/SCALE's existing paper-space routing).
- Acceptance — LENGTHEN (step 2):
  - eligible entities are Line, open Polyline, and a non-full-circle Arc; Circle, Ellipse, closed Polyline, a full-circle Arc, and every non-length-bearing entity kind (Annotation, FeatureLine, Surface, Mesh, FilledRegion, PdfUnderlay) are refused with a stated reason (REQ-201), never silently ignored;
  - four sub-modes — DElta (add/subtract a typed length), Percent (scale total length by a typed percentage), Total (set total length directly), DYnamic (interactive drag with a live preview) — each resolve to one target length, then apply it to the end of the picked entity nearest the pick point, holding the other end fixed, within REQ-101 tolerance of the hand-computed target. **The default sub-mode is Total** (amended 2026-08-24, D-2026-08-24-f — AutoCAD defaults to DElta; this deliberately does not), so that with the pick-first entry below the out-of-the-box interaction is: pick a line, read the length it reports, type the length it should be;
  - a target length that would collapse an entity to ~0 length, or push an Arc's sweep past a full circle, is rejected with a message rather than silently clamped or wrongly applied;
  - the active sub-mode persists across repeated picks within one invocation (typing a mode letter again mid-loop switches it and re-prompts for its value); the command loops back to "select object" after each successful apply until Enter/Esc; each individual apply is its own undo step, matching TRIM/OFFSET's per-target granularity, not one step per invocation;
  - **a pick made before the active sub-mode has a value is accepted, not refused** (amended 2026-08-24, D-2026-08-24-e): the picked object is latched, its current length is reported, and that sub-mode's value prompt opens; the value typed next applies to that object immediately rather than only arming the mode. Typing a mode letter at that prompt switches sub-mode and keeps the latched object (DYnamic hands it straight to the drag). A refused length (collapse-to-zero, arc past a full circle) clears the latch, so a later value can never silently apply to a stale object. Without this the Modify ribbon button was a dead end — the opening prompt invited a pick and the pick was rejected — and the command was reachable only by typing a mode letter *and* a number before picking;
  - reachable from the Modify ribbon, typed `LENGTHEN`/`LEN`, and right-click repeat; works on model-space and native paper-space Line/Arc/open-Polyline entities alike. In paper space the value prompt is unavailable (the paper path runs with no active model command to hold it — the same documented simplification MIRROR's paper path makes), so a valueless pick there reports the object's current length and says where to set the value, rather than refusing bare.
- Acceptance — EXTEND (step 3):
  - eligible boundary edges: any entity a user can select except Annotation, FeatureLine, Surface (refused with a stated reason, matching TRIM's existing boundary-edge refusal set); eligible targets: Line, open Polyline, non-full-circle Arc — the same set LENGTHEN established, refused with the same reasons for Circle, Ellipse, closed Polyline, full-circle Arc, and every non-length-bearing kind;
  - boundary intersection is analytic (`curveisect`, REQ-062's already-accepted library), never tessellated — a chord-approximated boundary does not meet REQ-101, the same reasoning that made REQ-062 analytic in the first place;
  - the end of the target nearest the pick extends, along the direction it already points (a Line/open-Polyline's own direction; an Arc's own circle, radius held fixed), to the nearest point where it meets a boundary edge, within REQ-101 tolerance of the hand-computed intersection; the other end stays exactly fixed;
  - a target that does not reach any boundary edge in the extending direction is refused with a stated reason, geometry unchanged — never silently ignored or extended the wrong way;
  - boundary-edge selection is a two-phase pick (edges, Enter, then targets — TRIM's own cutting-edge flow, copy-adapted, not shared code) with boundaries visually read as a selection while being picked, matching TRIM's precedent; the command loops back to "select object" after each successful extend until Enter/Esc; each individual extend is its own undo step, not one per invocation;
  - reachable from the Modify ribbon, typed `EXTEND`/`EX`, and right-click repeat; works in model space, floating model space, AND native paper space (two-phase click flow, no typed value needed so paper space is not simplified away the way MIRROR/LENGTHEN's paper paths are).
  - Acceptance — BREAK (step 4):
    - eligible entities: Line, Arc (any sweep, including a full-circle sweep), Circle, open
      Polyline, and closed Polyline; refused with a stated reason (REQ-201): Ellipse (no
      elliptical-arc entity kind exists in GoSurvey to hold a broken-open ellipse — adding one
      would be a genuinely new entity kind, which this step's own "no new entity kind" framing
      rules out), Annotation, FeatureLine, Surface, Mesh, FilledRegion, PdfUnderlay, Text, Mtext,
      and SurveyPoint;
    - the pick that selects the entity also supplies break point 1 — the closest point ON that
      entity to the pick, not the raw cursor position; a second pick supplies break point 2,
      likewise projected onto the already-selected entity; a break point coinciding with an
      entity's own endpoint (within REQ-101 tolerance) is treated as that endpoint exactly;
    - on an OPEN entity (Line, non-full Arc, open Polyline): the two break points are ordered by
      position along the entity (independent of click order), and the material between them is
      removed. Both points strictly interior → the original entity is shortened in place down to
      start→nearer-point, and a NEW duplicate entity (fresh id, REQ-076/ADR-027) is created for
      farther-point→end. One point coinciding with an existing endpoint → the entity is shortened
      in place from the other point only, no duplicate created. Both points coinciding with the
      two existing endpoints → refused ("would remove the entire entity"), geometry unchanged —
      never silently deleted;
    - on a CLOSED entity (Circle, full-circle-sweep Arc, closed Polyline): click order matters —
      the material swept from break point 1 to break point 2, travelling in the direction of
      increasing parameter (counterclockwise for Circle/full Arc; stored vertex order for closed
      Polyline), is removed, leaving one open result starting at point 2, ending at point 1 —
      matching AutoCAD's own circle-break convention. A Circle converts into a new Arc entity
      (fresh id — Circle and Arc are separate stores; this is a conversion between two entity
      kinds that already exist, not a new kind). A full-circle-sweep Arc is mutated in place (same
      id, no duplicate, no store change). A closed Polyline is mutated in place (same id, `Closed`
      flag cleared, vertex list rewritten to run point2→…→point1). The two break points landing at
      the identical position (a repeated pick) removes nothing and simply opens the closed entity
      at that point — a legitimate "break at point" case, not a no-op refusal;
    - each individual break is its own undo step; the command loops back to "select object" after
      each completed break until Enter/Esc, matching TRIM/LENGTHEN/EXTEND's per-target granularity
      and looping shape;
    - **between the two picks a live preview shows the material that will be removed** (amended
      2026-08-24, D-2026-08-24-e): the span from break point 1 to the cursor — projected onto the
      picked entity by the same `ClosestPointOnEntity` the second pick commits, never the raw
      cursor — is drawn in the preview style, with a marker at each break point. The previewed span
      follows the same ordering rule its commit does: position-ordered on an open entity (click
      order irrelevant), and on a closed entity the complement of the span the commit keeps, so
      reversing the click order visibly previews the other side. A repeated pick ("break at point")
      previews a zero-length span with both markers still shown. It is drawn opaque, in a warning
      colour, at highlight line width, on its own render channel — NOT in the translucent
      transform-preview batch, which is built for a ghost of geometry somewhere it is not yet and
      washes out to nothing when painted over the full-opacity object a removal preview sits on
      top of. **Model space only**: the GL pass that draws it is skipped whenever the active space
      is not model space, so neither paper space nor floating model space shows it — the same
      limit every other GL preview already has, stated rather than implied;
    - reachable from the Modify ribbon, typed `BREAK`/`BR`, and right-click repeat; works in model
      space, floating model space, and native paper space (pure two-click flow, no typed value
      needed, so paper space is not simplified away — same reasoning as EXTEND's step 3).
  - Acceptance — STRETCH (step 5):
    - a crossing/window selection box is picked first (left-to-right = window/fully-inside,
      right-to-left = crossing/overlap — the same rule REQ-039's paper-space parity already
      established), then a base point, then a destination point (or a typed relative
      displacement) — one displacement applies to the whole selection in a single apply, not a
      per-target loop (matching MOVE/ROTATE/SCALE's granularity, not TRIM/LENGTHEN/EXTEND/BREAK's);
    - for every entity in the box-selected set, each of its "definition points" is tested
      independently against the box and only the in-box ones move by the displacement — this is
      the genuine stretch effect for entities straddling the box boundary:
      - Line, Polyline (open or closed), and FeatureLine: every endpoint/vertex is independent (a
        FeatureLine's elevation is never altered by the move, matching MOVE/ROTATE/SCALE's own
        existing plan-only transform of it — REQ-087);
      - Arc: both endpoints are tested. Zero or both in-box → no-op or whole-arc translate,
        unchanged radius/angles. Exactly one in-box → the arc is genuinely reshaped: its center
        and radius are recomputed so it passes through the moved and fixed endpoints while
        preserving the original included angle (the "bulge"), matching AutoCAD; a full-circle-
        sweep Arc is exempt from this and instead follows the Circle rule below (its two
        endpoints coincide, so per-endpoint math is undefined); a stretch that would collapse
        the new chord to ~0 length is refused with a stated reason (REQ-201), the arc left
        unchanged, rather than corrupting it to a zero radius;
      - Circle, Ellipse (center only), Annotation/Text/Mtext/Dim (insertion point; dimension
        extension points are not independently tested), PdfUnderlay (insertion point),
        FilledRegion (one reference point, whole-region translate, no per-vertex boundary
        stretch), SurveyPoint (its own point): each has exactly one definition point and moves
        as a whole only if that point is in-box — matching AutoCAD's own behavior for these
        types (they are not "stretched," only moved-if-selected-and-in-window);
      - `Surface` and `Mesh` are excluded from the selection, consistent with the existing
        transform restrictions (`DropSurfacesFromSelectionForTransform`; Mesh is never edited);
    - a box-selected entity none of whose definition points land in the box is a legitimate
      no-op (still selected, simply unmoved) — not a refusal, matching AutoCAD;
    - one undo step restores the exact pre-stretch state for the whole apply;
    - works in model space, floating model space, and native paper space with true per-point
      partial stretch in both spaces (not simplified to whole-entity-only in paper space); a
      paper-space selection built by a plain click (not a box) degrades to a whole-entity
      translate for every selected entity, since no crossing/window box exists to test points
      against — matching AutoCAD's own degradation for a non-crossing pickfirst set;
    - the box/point-membership test itself operates in plain world-XY (model) or paper-inch XY
      (paper) coordinates, not projected through an orbited 3D camera the way the box-select's
      own entity-candidacy test optionally is — a stated, accepted simplification, recorded as
      technical debt rather than a silent gap;
    - reachable from the Modify ribbon, typed `STRETCH`, and right-click repeat.
  - Acceptance — FILLET (step 6a):
    - eligible curves: Line, non-full-circle Arc (full-circle-sweep Arc and Circle refused — no
      single tangent-side construction distinguishes them from a fillet's corner geometry, matching
      Circle's own exclusion from LENGTHEN/EXTEND for a related reason), and a segment of an open
      OR closed Polyline. A picked Polyline segment is one of two cases, resolved by which second
      pick follows: **(A) the other pick lands on the segment immediately ADJACENT (sharing exactly
      one vertex) on the SAME polyline** — the classic "round this corner" case, well-defined on
      open or closed polylines alike, since the shared vertex needs no near/far disambiguation; **(B)
      the other pick is a different entity (or a non-adjacent segment of a different polyline)** —
      only the polyline's own first or last segment (adjacent to a free/open end) is eligible this
      way, since moving any other segment's endpoint would silently disturb an uninvolved neighboring
      segment sharing that vertex; a closed polyline has no free end, so it is never eligible for
      case (B). An interior segment of an open polyline, picked against a different entity (not its
      own polyline neighbor), and any non-adjacent pair of segments on the same polyline, are refused
      with a stated reason (REQ-201) rather than silently misapplied. Picking the identical segment
      twice is refused ("select two different objects/segments");
    - **radius** is a persisted setting (`filletRadius`, default 0.5, like `TRIMSTATE`'s own
      app-level persistence via `gosurvey-user.json` — not per-drawing) set by typing `R` before a
      pick ("Specify fillet radius <current>:"), applying to this and future invocations until
      changed again;
    - **trim mode** is a persisted setting (`cornerTrimMode`, default Trim) set by typing `T` before
      a pick ("Enter Trim mode option [Trim/No trim] <Trim>:"), **shared with CHAMFER** (matching
      AutoCAD's own shared `TRIMMODE` variable — one toggle governs both commands). Trim mode moves
      each curve's near end (nearest its own pick) to its tangent point, exactly as described below;
      No-trim mode adds the fillet arc at the same computed tangent points but leaves both original
      curves completely unchanged (a real AutoCAD behavior, not a simplification);
    - flow: `FILLET` prompts "Select first object or [Radius/Trim]:"; a pick latches the first curve
      and its pick point; a second pick on an eligible partner computes and applies the fillet
      immediately (no separate confirm step); the command then loops back to "select first object"
      until Enter/Esc — REQ-103's own established per-target looping shape (TRIM/LENGTHEN/EXTEND/
      BREAK), deliberately without AutoCAD's opt-in "Multiple" option, since looping is already this
      epic's default and an opt-out would be the inconsistent choice; each individual fillet is its
      own undo step;
    - **geometry (radius > 0, non-parallel case):** each curve's supporting shape (a Line's infinite
      extension; a non-full Arc's own full circle, `curveisect::MakeCircle` not `MakeArc` — an
      Extend-precedent choice, so a tangent point beyond the current sweep is still found and the
      arc extended to reach it) is offset by exactly the fillet radius on both sides (Line: parallel
      line translated ± radius along its own perpendicular; Arc/Circle-equivalent: concentric circle
      of radius ± the fillet radius); every combination of the two curves' offset shapes is
      intersected (analytically, via the existing `curveisect::IntersectSegSeg`/`IntersectSegConic`/
      `IntersectConicConic` — REQ-062/REQ-101, never tessellated) to produce every candidate fillet
      center; the candidate chosen is the one minimizing the summed squared distance to the two pick
      points — a deterministic, testable tie-break consistent with every other REQ-103 step's
      "nearest to the pick" convention (LENGTHEN/EXTEND/BREAK/TRIM all resolve ambiguity this way);
    - the tangent point on a Line is the foot of the perpendicular from the chosen center onto the
      line's own infinite extension; the tangent point on an Arc is the point on the arc's own
      original circle along the ray from the arc's center through the chosen fillet center (this
      point is guaranteed to already lie exactly on that circle by construction of the offset
      intersection); the fillet arc itself runs from one tangent point to the other around the
      chosen center, taking the smaller of the two possible sweeps (< π always, since a corner-round
      is always the minor arc) — a fresh Arc entity (REQ-076/ADR-027, id 0 until swept), never a
      mutation of either input;
    - **radius = 0** is a valid, well-defined degenerate case, not a refusal: the offset-by-0
      construction reduces to intersecting the two original curves directly (same analytic
      functions, unchanged), no Arc entity is created, and both curves are trimmed/extended (Trim
      mode) directly to that intersection point — matching AutoCAD's own R=0 "sharp corner" behavior;
    - **two parallel, non-collinear Lines** are a special case independent of the current radius
      setting (a real, documented AutoCAD behavior, not a simplification): a semicircular Arc is
      created connecting the two lines' nearest-facing endpoints, with a radius of exactly half the
      perpendicular distance between them; the current `filletRadius` setting is ignored for this
      one case, exactly as AutoCAD ignores it too. Collinear/overlapping Lines, and any radius/
      geometry combination with no real tangent solution (radius too large for the available
      geometry, arcs too far apart, etc.), are refused with a stated reason (REQ-201), geometry
      unchanged — never silently clamped or wrongly applied;
    - in the Case (A) same-polyline-adjacent-vertex flow, the shared vertex is replaced by the two
      tangent points (vertex list grows by one; CSR offsets for every later polyline shift, the same
      bookkeeping BREAK's `ReplacePolylineVerts` already established) and the new Arc entity is
      inserted for the corner — or, at radius 0, the shared vertex simply moves to the single
      intersection point (vertex count unchanged, no Arc). In the Case (B) flow, the standalone
      curve is trimmed/extended to its tangent point via the exact same reused mutation the standard
      curve case uses below;
    - each Line/Arc/open-polyline-end-segment curve's trim/extend to its own tangent point reuses
      LENGTHEN's own mutation functions unchanged — `ApplyLengthenToLine`/`ApplyLengthenToArc`/
      `ApplyLengthenToPolylineEnd` — by converting the known tangent point into the `newLength` those
      functions already accept (a Line's new length is the distance from its fixed end to the
      tangent point; an Arc's follows the identical angle-to-length conversion EXTEND's own
      `FindExtendArcTarget` already established), exactly the reuse chain REQ-103's own sequencing
      note promised ("LENGTHEN's edge-parameter math is reused by EXTEND and FILLET"); the near end
      (the one that moves) is whichever end lies closer to that curve's own pick point, the same
      `NearerToFirstPoint` convention LENGTHEN/EXTEND already use;
    - reachable from the Modify ribbon (new column, no pre-staged stub exists), typed `FILLET`/`F`,
      and right-click repeat; works in model space, floating model space, and native paper space
      (full parity, matching EXTEND/BREAK/STRETCH's precedent, not TRIM's own paper-space gap).
  - Acceptance — CHAMFER (step 6b):
    - eligible curves: Line and a segment of an open or closed Polyline only — Arc is refused with a
      stated reason (REQ-201): a chamfer is a straight connecting line measured by distance/angle
      along each curve from their intersection, which has no standard meaning against a curved Arc
      (matching AutoCAD's own restriction — CHAMFER has never operated on arcs); the same Case (A)
      same-polyline-adjacent-vertex / Case (B) end-segment-only-against-a-different-entity split, and
      the same non-adjacent/interior-segment/identical-segment-twice refusals, apply exactly as
      FILLET's Polyline rules above;
    - **distances/angle** are persisted settings (`chamferDist1`/`chamferDist2`, default 0.5 each,
      for Distance/Distance mode; `chamferAngle`, default 45°, reusing `chamferDist1` as the single
      Distance/Angle-mode distance) — `gosurvey-user.json`-persisted exactly like `filletRadius`;
      **mode** (`chamferMode`: Distance/Distance default, or Distance/Angle) is set by typing `D` or
      `A` before a pick, each prompting for its own value(s); **trim mode is the same persisted
      `cornerTrimMode` setting FILLET uses** (AutoCAD's own shared `TRIMMODE`, not a second toggle);
    - flow mirrors FILLET's exactly: `CHAMFER` prompts "Select first line or [Distance/Angle/Trim]:",
      first pick latches the curve, second pick on an eligible partner computes and applies
      immediately, loops back until Enter/Esc, one undo step per chamfer;
    - **geometry:** `P` = the intersection of the two curves' infinite extensions (`curveisect::
      IntersectSegSeg`, unchanged; parallel/non-intersecting Lines are refused — REQ-201 — since,
      unlike FILLET, CHAMFER has no AutoCAD analogue to FILLET's parallel-lines semicircle special
      case, a real asymmetry between the two commands, not an oversight). Distance/Distance mode:
      Point1 = P + `chamferDist1` along curve 1's own direction, away from P, toward the side the
      curve1 pick landed on; Point2 = the same construction on curve 2 with `chamferDist2`.
      Distance/Angle mode: Point1 = P + `chamferDist1` along curve 1 the same way; the chamfer line's
      direction is curve 1's own direction rotated by `chamferAngle` toward curve 2's side from
      Point1, and Point2 is that ray's intersection with curve 2's infinite extension (refused,
      REQ-201, if parallel to curve 2 — no intersection exists);
    - **both distances (or the single Distance/Angle-mode distance) equal to 0** is a valid,
      well-defined degenerate case mirroring FILLET's radius-0 case: no chamfer Line entity is
      created, and (Trim mode) both curves are trimmed/extended directly to `P`;
    - Trim mode moves each curve's near end (nearest its own pick) to its own computed point (Point1/
      Point2 respectively), reusing `ApplyLengthenToLine`/`ApplyLengthenToPolylineEnd` the identical
      way FILLET's Line/Polyline cases do (CHAMFER never touches `ApplyLengthenToArc` — Arc is not
      an eligible curve); the new chamfer Line entity (fresh id, REQ-076/ADR-027) connects Point1 to
      Point2 regardless of trim mode; No-trim mode adds that Line without altering either curve, the
      same behavior FILLET's No-trim mode has;
    - reachable from the Modify ribbon (same new column as FILLET), typed `CHAMFER`/`CHA`, and
      right-click repeat; works in model space, floating model space, and native paper space (full
      parity, matching FILLET's own paper-space scope above).
  - Acceptance for ARRAY/EXPLODE (steps 7–8) is written when each is accepted for implementation,
    not spec'd in advance of that command's own design pass.
- Owner-layer: Commands/Domain/UI
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-23 — catalogued, proposed (D-2026-08-23-i). 2026-08-23 — accepted; sequenced into 8 increments starting with MIRROR; MIRROR's acceptance conditions written; MIRRTEXT-off and erase-default-No confirmed with the user (D-2026-08-23-j, TASK-094). 2026-08-24 — LENGTHEN's (step 2) acceptance conditions written (D-2026-08-24-a, TASK-095). 2026-08-24 — EXTEND's (step 3) acceptance conditions written; analytic-over-tessellated boundary intersection and paper-space-included both confirmed with the user (D-2026-08-24-b, TASK-096). 2026-08-24 — BREAK's (step 4) acceptance conditions written; Circle/full-circle-Arc target eligibility (converts to Arc) and closed-Polyline target eligibility (splits open) both confirmed with the user (D-2026-08-24-c, TASK-097). 2026-08-24 — STRETCH's (step 5) acceptance conditions written; full AutoCAD-parity arc partial-stretch (center/radius recompute preserving included angle) and full paper-space vertex-level parity both confirmed with the user (D-2026-08-24-d, TASK-098). 2026-08-24 — after the first hand-driven GUI pass: LENGTHEN's valueless first pick amended from a refusal to a latch-and-prompt (the ribbon button was a dead end), and a live removed-span preview added to BREAK's acceptance (D-2026-08-24-e, TASK-100, TASK-101). 2026-08-24 — LENGTHEN's default sub-mode changed from DElta to Total, so pick-then-type-the-new-length is the out-of-the-box flow (D-2026-08-24-f, TASK-100). 2026-08-24 — FILLET's and CHAMFER's (step 6a/6b) acceptance conditions written; full AutoCAD-parity scope (Line/Arc/Polyline-segment eligibility, a Trim/No-trim toggle shared between the two commands, full paper-space parity, and both Distance/Distance and Distance/Angle chamfer input) confirmed with the user (D-2026-08-24-g, TASK-102/TASK-103). 2026-08-25 — the "select objects" shape MOVE/COPY/ROTATE/SCALE/MIRROR established and this REQ's later steps (STRETCH, ARRAY, ALIGN — REQ-039) all reused was two-corner window/crossing box only: no individual-entity click, no accumulating across more than one box, no confirm-on-Enter. A user report against ARRAY (REQ-305) found this the same real gap in every one of them, not ARRAY alone; the shared shape is now click-and/or-box, additive, accumulating until Enter confirms it (D-2026-08-25-n) — applied to MOVE, COPY, SCALE, ROTATE, MIRROR, and ALIGN. STRETCH (step 5) is deliberately excluded: its crossing box is load-bearing geometry (which vertices move), not just an object filter, so it keeps the original box-only shape.

### REQ-104 — Draw-command completeness
- Purpose: SPLINE, XLINE, RAY, DONUT, SOLID, REVCLOUD, WIPEOUT, and MLINE have no command at all
- Priority: could
- Type: functional
- Statement: Add the commands above, each stored, selectable, snappable, undoable, and round-tripping through `.gs` and DXF like existing entities.
- Acceptance (sketch): live preview, commit on the snapped point per the project's preview-vs-commit invariant; each new entity kind is added at every integration site (selection, extents, layer, undo, `.gs`, DXF, render, snap, grips, properties); a spline's chord deviation is within REQ-101 wherever REQ-101 applies.
- Owner-layer: Commands/Domain/IO/UI
- Status: proposed
- Revisions: 2026-08-23 — catalogued (D-2026-08-23-i)

### REQ-105 — Inquiry commands
- Purpose: AREA, DIST, LIST, and MASSPROP are missing outside the Properties panel (which only reports a circle's area)
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Add the commands above, reusing existing geometry/snap infrastructure; read-only, no undo entry.
- Acceptance (sketch): AREA reports area/perimeter for polylines, rectangles and circles within REQ-101; DIST reports distance and delta X/Y/(Z) between two snapped points; LIST prints an entity's stored properties; MASSPROP reports at least area/perimeter/centroid for a closed region.
- Owner-layer: Commands/UI
- Status: proposed
- Revisions: 2026-08-23 — catalogued (D-2026-08-23-i)

### REQ-106 — View-management commands
- Purpose: no view-stack undo, no named views, no isometric presets beyond the ViewCube's standard faces
- Priority: could
- Type: functional
- Statement: Add ZOOM PREVIOUS (pan/zoom/orbit history), named views (save/restore a camera state by name), a VIEW command/dialog to manage them, and one-click NE/NW/SE/SW isometric presets.

  **A named view records the camera's inputs and the active frame** — pan, zoom, azimuth, elevation
  and the UCS — not a derived matrix, so a saved view cannot mean something different from what the
  live view would do with the same numbers. The UCS travels with it because a view restored without
  its frame puts the camera back but changes what the next typed coordinate means.

  `VIEW [Save/Restore/Delete/?] <name>` is inline in every form, and `VIEW` alone opens the View
  Manager. The case-insensitive name matching deliberately mirrors `UCS Named`, so learning one
  teaches the other.

  **The View Manager also lists the drawing's named coordinate systems, and is the only place a
  saved frame can be restored by name or deleted** (REQ-154). That is not a second home for a
  command's options: `UCS Named` saves and nothing more, precisely because restoring and deleting
  need a list of what exists, which a command prompt cannot show. The dialog's two buttons call the
  same shared functions any other caller would, so there is still one implementation.

  **The View tab carries a Named Views panel**: a combo naming the current view — the saved name when
  the camera and frame match one, `Unsaved View` otherwise — listing the ten standard orientations
  (Top / Bottom / Left / Right / Front / Back and the four isometrics), then this drawing's saved
  views, then the View Manager. The orientation presets set direction only, keeping pan and zoom,
  because "show me this from the south-west" should not also move what you were looking at. Their
  angles come from the ViewCube's own face table and isometric constant, not a second copy.

  Which view is current is **derived** from the live camera each time, never stored as a flag: a
  remembered name goes stale the moment the user pans, and a label naming a view you have already
  left is worse than no label, since `Unsaved View` is precisely the warning that what you see would
  be lost.
- Acceptance (sketch): ZOOM PREVIOUS steps back through recent view changes; a named view restores camera position/target/UCS exactly; isometric presets set the standard 3D-isometric angle in one action. DVIEW and multiple simultaneous model-space viewports are noted as open scope questions, not committed here, given their size.
- Owner-layer: UI/Renderer
- Status: **partially delivered** (2026-08-29) — named views, the `VIEW` command, the View Manager
  and the ten orientation presets are built and persist in `.gs`. **ZOOM PREVIOUS is NOT built**, so
  this requirement is not closed; the view-history half remains as originally catalogued.
- Revisions: 2026-08-23 — catalogued (D-2026-08-23-i). 2026-08-29 — named views, VIEW, the View
  Manager and the orientation presets delivered at the user's request during hands-on testing;
  Statement expanded to describe what was built. ZOOM PREVIOUS deliberately left out of that pass.
### REQ-107 — Block support (foundational)
- Purpose: GoSurvey has no block/insert mechanism, which blocks title-block reuse, standard symbols, and any future TABLE/annotation work; DWG export always explodes geometry for exactly this reason
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Add BLOCK (define from selection), INSERT (place with position/scale/rotation), WBLOCK (write to its own file), and ATTDEF/block attributes. Dynamic blocks and a block-library browser are explicitly out of scope — see roadmap Someday.
- Acceptance (sketch): a block definition stores its entities once; each INSERT is a lightweight reference, not a geometry copy; editing a definition updates every insert; DWG/DXF export writes real INSERT/BLOCK records; erasing a definition with live inserts is handled per REQ-201, never silently.
- Acceptance (block editor — BEDIT in-place isolated editing, D-2026-08-29-h / ADR-043):
  - BEDIT with a block name from model space enters an **edit session** for that definition; BEDIT
    is refused while a paper layout is active; a second BEDIT for the block already open is a no-op.
  - While a session is open the viewport shows **only that block's geometry** in the block's local
    coordinates; model-space and paper-space entities are not drawn and not pickable/snappable;
    the block's own INSERT overlays are not drawn.
  - Draw commands (LINE, PLINE, CIRCLE, ARC, ELLIPSE, TEXT/MTEXT) and modify commands (MOVE, COPY,
    ROTATE, SCALE, DELETE, TRIM, OFFSET, MIRROR) operate on the block's content; survey-point and
    CSV tools are unavailable in the session.
  - Any content change marks the session dirty.
  - `BCLOSE` (or the ribbon Close Block Editor) with a dirty session raises a modal **Save /
    Don't Save / Cancel**: Save writes the edited geometry into the definition and every INSERT of
    that block re-renders; Don't Save restores the definition as it was at BEDIT; Cancel keeps the
    session open. A clean session closes with no prompt.
  - On close (Save or Don't Save) the ribbon tab and the viewport camera that were active when
    BEDIT was invoked are restored.
  - Nested blocks, meshes, attribute definitions, parameters and actions on the definition are
    preserved unchanged across an edit session.
- Acceptance (INSERT on-screen interaction, D-2026-08-29-i):
  - When any of insertion point / scale / rotation is "Specify On-screen", a **live ghost** of the
    block definition (its lines, arcs, circles, polylines and nested blocks, tessellated) is drawn
    at the pending transform and follows the cursor: rotating live during the rotation pick (angle
    in the clockwise-from-north convention, pick-north ⇒ rotation 0 ⇒ block as authored), scaling
    live and uniformly during the scale pick (factor = distance from insertion point to cursor).
    The ghost is drawn at the **snapped** commit point, honours the block-unit scale factor and
    base point, and the committed insert matches the last previewed transform within REQ-101.
  - Object snapping is active for the insertion-point, scale and rotation picks, subject to the
    running OSNAP toggles and the master object-snap switch.
  - The geometry of an **already-placed block instance** (including nested) is an object-snap
    target for all commands: Endpoint on its segment ends and its insertion point, Midpoint on its
    segment midpoints, Center on its circles/arcs — same tolerance and ranking as native entities.
    The ghost being inserted is never itself a snap target.

### REQ-108 — Polar and tracking input aids
- Purpose: the POLAR status-bar toggle lights up with no behavior behind it, there is no object-snap tracking, and there's no typed polar-coordinate entry
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: (a) POLAR shows angle guide lines from the last point at a configured increment and snaps the typed/dragged distance to that angle; (b) object-snap tracking lets a hovered snap point become a temporary tracking reference to move along; (c) `@distance<angle` is accepted anywhere a relative point can be typed, alongside the existing bearing-lock (`A <angle>` then distance) workflow.
- Acceptance (sketch): polar guides snap the cursor within a small pixel tolerance at the configured increment; tracking references clear when a command ends; `@100<45` and the equivalent bearing-lock sequence commit the identical point within REQ-101.

### REQ-109 — Lit shading for TIN surfaces
- Purpose: `SHADED` and `HIDDEN` render a TIN surface as wireframe only, pixel-identical to `2D` — verified by capture — while imported meshes and hatches already shade correctly under REQ-064
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Extend REQ-064's visual-style/lighting pipeline (triangle shader, depth buffer, camera-following light) to TIN surfaces.
- Acceptance (sketch): a TIN surface captured at `2D`/`Hidden`/`Shaded` is no longer pixel-identical across styles; `Hidden` occludes correctly; `Shaded` lighting follows the camera per REQ-064's existing rule; REQ-100's surface frame-budget profile still holds with shading on.

### REQ-110 — Annotative rescale of existing text
- Purpose: changing plot/viewport scale repositions survey-point labels but never resizes already-placed TEXT/MTEXT, unlike AutoCAD's annotative objects
- Priority: could
- Type: functional
- Statement: Existing text/MTEXT can optionally be marked annotative so a plot-scale or viewport-scale change resizes it to hold a constant plotted height, matching what REQ-050 already does for MTEXT drawn live through a viewport.
- Acceptance (sketch): a non-annotative object's height is unchanged by a scale change (today's behavior, preserved); an annotative object's on-screen size changes to hold plotted height constant; the flag persists in DXF/`.gs`; REQ-101 fidelity on stored coordinates is untouched.

### REQ-111 — Associative DIMENSION entity
- Purpose: GoSurvey has no dimension object; EVERY dimension kind exports as exploded lines plus text, which is not associative and doesn't round-trip as a dimension. (Corrected 2026-09-03, issue #252: this line said "an aligned dimension", and an angular one exported as the text ALONE - no arc, no rays, no vertex - because the DXF writer rebuilt dimension geometry by hand and its branch covered the aligned and linear kinds only. That is fixed; the inaccuracy is recorded because it is what let the gap sit unnoticed.)
- Priority: could
- Type: functional
- Statement: Add a DIMENSION entity (at minimum linear/aligned) that stores its definition points, updates its displayed measurement when the dimensioned geometry moves, and round-trips as a real DXF `DIMENSION`.
- Acceptance (sketch): dragging dimensioned geometry updates the displayed value and leader within REQ-101; DXF round-trip preserves it as a `DIMENSION`, not exploded geometry; erasing the dimensioned geometry is handled per REQ-201, not silently.
- Owner-layer: Domain/Commands/IO/Renderer
- Status: proposed
- Revisions: 2026-08-23 — catalogued (D-2026-08-23-i) 2026-09-03 — Purpose corrected (issue #252, TASK-193); the requirement itself is unchanged and stays proposed.

### REQ-112 — Binary DXF import
- Purpose: only ASCII DXF is read; a binary DXF must be round-tripped through AutoCAD's Save As first
- Priority: could
- Type: functional
- Statement: `DxfIo` detects and reads binary-encoded DXF (the `AutoCAD Binary DXF` sentinel header) alongside the existing ASCII parser.
- Acceptance (sketch): a binary DXF and its ASCII Save-As of the same drawing import to identical GoSurvey state; a malformed/truncated binary DXF is rejected per REQ-001, not partially absorbed.
- Owner-layer: IO
- Status: proposed — **subsumed by REQ-170** when LibreDWG’s DXF path is verified (D-2026-08-29-g);

### REQ-113 — DXF paper-space import
- Purpose: since REQ-037 gave GoSurvey native paper-space geometry, an imported DXF's paper-space entities and title block have somewhere real to go, but import still discards them and only logs a count
- Priority: could
- Type: functional
- Statement: DXF import reconstructs each paper-space layout's entities into GoSurvey's native `PaperLayout` store (REQ-037/ADR-009), the same way model-space entities and REQ-023 survey points already reconstruct.
- Acceptance (sketch): importing a DXF with a title block and paper-space annotations recreates them as editable native paper-space entities on the matching layout tab; entity types with no paper-space import branch yet are named in the log, not silently dropped (REQ-201).

### REQ-114 — Autosave, backup, and crash recovery
- Purpose: there is no safety net between manual `Ctrl+S` saves; a crash or accidental close loses unsaved work
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Periodically autosave the working drawing to a recovery location at a configurable interval, keep the previous save as a `.bak`, and on next launch after an unclean shutdown offer to recover the autosaved state.
- Acceptance (sketch): autosave fires at the configured interval with no modal/perceptible hitch; a normal `Ctrl+S` still writes the real file and rotates the `.bak`; killing the process mid-session and relaunching offers recovery of the newer state; declining recovery leaves the last manual save untouched.

- Acceptance (sketch): opening or saving a file adds/moves it to the top of the list; the list persists across restarts; a since-moved/deleted path fails gracefully per REQ-201 rather than crashing; clearing empties it.

- Statement: Extend REQ-084's customization precedent to keyboard accelerators and typed-command aliases, persisted in user preferences.
- Acceptance (sketch): a user can rebind a shortcut and define/edit a typed alias; a conflicting rebind is flagged, not silently overwritten (REQ-201); a reset action restores defaults; unrebound shortcuts keep working.

- Acceptance (sketch): with grid snap on and no nearby object-snap candidate, a click lands exactly on the nearest grid intersection; an active object snap still takes priority; toggling grid snap off restores today's free-cursor behavior; the setting persists like other display preferences (REQ-020-style).

### REQ-118 — A polyline closes by clicking its start, and ends on Enter
- Purpose: finishing a polyline requires typing `CLOSE` or `END`. No established CAD requires
  either, so the most common drawing operation in the program is the one that makes the user stop
  and recall command syntax
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: While a `POLYLINE` (or `3DPOLY`) draft is active, its **starting vertex is an Endpoint
  object-snap candidate**, so the cursor lands on it exactly and the existing snap marker shows it.
  Committing a point that coincides with that starting vertex **closes** the polyline, writes the
  closing segment, and ends the command — with no `CLOSE` keyword. A bare **Enter** finishes the
  draft as an **open** polyline, adds no closing segment, and ends the command.

  `CLOSE`/`CL` and `END` remain accepted; they are no longer *required*. The minimum-vertex rules
  are unchanged (three to close, two to end open), and below three vertices the starting vertex is
  **not offered as a snap candidate** — so the invalid close cannot be attempted, rather than being
  refused after the fact.

  Close detection is by **coincidence with the stored first vertex**, not by asking the snap system
  what the user meant. The snap makes the point reachable; it does not decide the command. Anything
  that lands on the first vertex — snap, typed coordinate, or an exact click — closes the polyline.

  Enter **ends the command** rather than restarting it. This differs deliberately from `LINE`, whose
  blank Enter starts a fresh chain: a polyline is one object and finishing it is finishing the
  command, where LINE's chain is a run of independent segments.
- Acceptance:
  - four picks, the fourth on the starting vertex, produce **one closed** polyline and the command ends;
  - three picks then Enter produce **one open** polyline, with no closing segment, and the command ends;
  - with only two vertices a pick on the starting vertex does **not** close — it is an ordinary
    vertex, and the starting vertex offers no snap candidate at that point;
  - `CLOSE` and `END` still work and still report through REQ-201;
  - snapping to all other geometry is unaffected while a draft is active;
  - Esc mid-draft leaves the polyline count unchanged in both spaces;
  - `3DPOLY` behaves identically, each vertex keeping its own elevation (REQ-085);
  - all of the above hold in **paper space** as well as model space (REQ-039 (5)/(6)).
- Owner-layer: Commands (the state machine), Viewport (the snap candidate)

  REQ-304/issue #82 — `D-2026-08-25-j` collided with master's independent REQ-303, see REQ-303's
  duplication note above); issue #80

### REQ-119 — Command variants are clickable wherever they are prompted (GitHub issue #81)
- Purpose: the command line tells the user which keyword options a command accepts, but only one
  prompt in the entire program renders them as anything the mouse can reach. A user who does not
  already know the shortcut has no way to discover it except by reading prose and guessing what to
  type — which is the opposite of what a prompt is for
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A **command variant** is a keyword option a command accepts at its current prompt
  (`Azimuth`, `3P`, `Reference`, `Copy`, `Close`, `DElta`). Every variant a prompt names is
  **both** typeable and **clickable**, and the two paths are the same path: a click submits the
  variant's shortcut through `ProcessCommandLineSubmit` — the identical entry point Enter uses on
  typed text — so keyboard and mouse cannot drift apart by construction.

  The mechanism is a **text convention, not a data structure**. A variant is declared by writing
  it into the prompt string in the form the codebase already uses, and the renderer derives the
  clickable region and the submitted token from that text. Two forms are recognized:

  - **Inline** — `[A]zimuth`, `[2P]`, `[3P]`: the bracketed run is the shortcut and the link label;
    any trailing lowercase continues as plain text.
  - **Grouped** — `[DElta/Percent/Total/DYnamic]`, `[Y]es/[N]o`: each `/`-separated option becomes
    its **own** link, and each option's shortcut is its **leading run of uppercase letters and
    digits** (`DElta`→`DE`, `Percent`→`P`, `DYnamic`→`DY`, `Yes`→`Y`). Separators and brackets
    render as plain text.

  This convention is chosen deliberately over a declared `{display, shortcut, action}` table: the
  capitalization rule is already how this codebase writes these prompts, so the convention reads
  the intent that is there rather than adding an abstraction with no second present-day use
  (CLAUDE.md rule 2). The cost is accepted and named: the shortcut is *implied* by the prompt text
  rather than declared beside the handler, so a prompt may name a token the command does not
  accept. Acceptance therefore requires that every marked-up token be **verified against the
  command's own text handler**, and that verification is part of the work, not a later audit.

  **One renderer serves every surface.** The floating command bar and the classic docked panel
  render variants through the **same** function; no command implements click handling of its own.
  The renderer is **wrap-aware** — it breaks between segments when the next one will not fit the
  content region — because the docked panel's prompts are long and wrap today.

  **A live prompt is clickable; history is not.** There are **three** places a prompt string can
  come from, and only two of them are prompts:

  | Surface | Role | Rendered |
  |---|---|---|
  | `CommandInputHint` (UI) | the live prompt | **clickable** |
  | `*FooterHint` (Commands) | the live prompt | **clickable** |
  | `log.push_back` | history | **plain text — never clickable** |

  The command log is a record of what already happened. A prompt that has scrolled into it is no
  longer live, and making it clickable would let a user submit a token to a command that has since
  moved on. So a command whose options are announced **only** in the log has no clickable variants
  by construction — the fix is to give that command a **live prompt entry**, not to make the log
  interactive.

  **REQ-304 has already closed the gap this rule was written for, and in doing so made the
  defect worse.** When REQ-119 was first drafted, `FILLET` (`[Radius/Trim]`, `[Trim/No trim]`),
  `CHAMFER` (`[Distance/Angle/Trim]`, `[Trim/No trim]`) and `ELEV` (`W`orld) announced their
  options **only** in the log, and eight commands had no live prompt at all. REQ-304 (issue #82)
  audited the same `Kind` enum, reached the same conclusion about `Pan`/`Orbit`, and gave all
  eight a live prompt through `DrawingExtrasFooterHint`. Authoring those prompts is therefore
  **no longer part of this requirement** — it is done.

  The consequence is that five grouped-variant prompts are now on the **live, clickable** path
  while the renderer still reads only to the first `]`, so each renders as one link submitting a
  token its own command rejects:

  ```
  FILLET: Select first object or [Radius/Trim] …          -> "radius/trim"
  FILLET: Trim mode [Trim/No trim] …                      -> "trim/no trim"
  CHAMFER: Select first object or [Distance/Angle/Trim] … -> "distance/angle/trim"   (two variants)
  CHAMFER: Trim mode [Trim/No trim] …                     -> "trim/no trim"
  ```

  Together with `MIRROR` and `LENGTHEN` that is **seven** dead links, not two — which is why
  increment 1 is the parser and not the markup: fixing the reader repairs all seven at once, and
  every one of them is already written in the notation this rule reads.

  The live-vs-history split stands as the governing rule regardless: a command that announces
  options only in the log still has no clickable variants, and the fix for that is always a live
  prompt, never an interactive log. A command that genuinely has no variants needs no markup, but
  it must be **audited and recorded as having none**, not silently skipped.

  Clickable variants are visually distinct from surrounding prompt text, carry a hover state, and
  do not interfere with coordinate or text entry at the same prompt.
- Sequencing: **two increments.**
  - **Increment 1 — the mechanism.** Grouped-form and shortcut-extraction parsing; wrap-aware
    layout; the docked panel routed through the shared renderer; the hand-rolled LINE-only link
    block deleted; the parsing rule extracted as a **pure function** and unit-tested. LINE's
    `[A]`/`[2P]` and the two currently-defective grouped prompts are correct at the end of this
    increment.
  - **Increment 2 — the coverage audit.** Command-by-command normalization of the remaining prompt
    strings across both hint families, each token verified against its handler, with headless
    transcript coverage per command. Deliberately left unscoped until reached. It is a pure
    markup pass: REQ-304 already authored the live prompts that were missing, so nothing here
    writes a prompt that does not exist — it only teaches existing ones to say `[Radius/Trim]`
    where they currently say `type R (Radius) or T (Trim)`.
- Acceptance:
  - **Increment 1:**
    - clicking `[A]` is indistinguishable from typing `a`, and `[2P]` from typing `2p`, in **both**
      the floating bar and the docked panel — same resulting command state, same log lines;
    - `Erase source objects? [Yes/No] <N>:` renders **two** links; clicking `Yes` erases the
      source objects and clicking `No` does not. Today it renders **one** link that submits
      `yes/no`, which the command rejects;
    - `FILLET: Select first object or [Radius/Trim] …` renders **two** links submitting `r` and
      `t`, and `CHAMFER: Select first object or [Distance/Angle/Trim] …` **three** submitting
      `d`, `a`, `t` — the tokens `HandleFilletText`/`HandleChamferText` accept. These reached the
      clickable path with REQ-304 and are dead links until this increment lands;
    - `LENGTHEN — select object, or [DElta/Percent/Total/DYnamic]:` renders **four** links
      submitting `de`, `p`, `t`, `dy` — each the token `TryLengthenModeToggle` accepts. Today it
      renders one link submitting `delta/percent/total/dynamic`, which the command rejects;
    - a prompt whose text wraps in the docked panel still renders every link on the correct line,
      with no horizontal overflow;
    - no command contains click-handling code of its own;
    - the prompt→variants rule is a pure function covered by `CommandLineTests`, including: inline,
      grouped, mixed-case shortcut extraction, a bracket with no closing `]`, and an empty group.
  - **Increment 2:** every variant a **live prompt** names is clickable; every clickable token is
    accepted by that command's text handler in that state; no variant loses its keyboard path;
    every `AppCommandState::Kind` is either marked up or recorded as having no variants (none is
    silently skipped); and **no log line is clickable**.

  2026-08-25 — amended (D-2026-08-25-p, relabeled from D-2026-08-25-n for the same reason). Two
  things, one review and one collision. The
  Verification review of TASK-111's plan found a **third prompt surface** the original text did
  not account for — the log — and added the live-vs-history rule. Rebasing onto `beta` then found
  **REQ-304 had already authored** the live prompts for the eight commands that lacked them, so
  that half of the amendment was dropped as done, and increment 2 shrank back to a pure markup
  pass. REQ-304 also moved five grouped-variant prompts onto the clickable path, taking the live
  defect from two dead links to **seven** — recorded here because it is now increment 1's
  strongest motivation, not a footnote.


### REQ-120 — Double-tapping the middle mouse button zooms to extents (GitHub issue #88)
- Purpose: framing the whole drawing is the most-repeated view action there is, and today it costs
  a typed `ZOOMEXTENTS`/`ZE`. Every CAD user already has the muscle memory for AutoCAD's
  wheel double-click; GoSurvey binds that gesture to nothing
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: **Double-clicking the middle mouse button over the drawing viewport zooms to
  extents**, matching AutoCAD's binding for the same gesture. It reuses the existing zoom-extents
  path — `ZOOMEXTENTS`/`ZE` are unchanged and remain the typed route to the same result.

  **The gesture is transparent.** Unlike the typed command, which refuses while a command is
  running ("finish or cancel the active command first"), the double-click works **mid-command**:
  a user halfway through a `LINE` can reframe and carry on picking points. This is deliberate and
  matches AutoCAD, where view operations are transparent. It changes the *view* only — the active
  command's phase, its picked points and its draft geometry are untouched, because zooming writes
  the camera and nothing else.

  **Space-aware.** What gets framed depends on where the user is, mirroring where middle-drag pan
  already works (REQ-045):

  | Space | Frames |
  |---|---|
  | Model | the model's entity extents (the existing computation) |
  | Floating model space (inside an activated viewport) | the model's entity extents, framed into the VIEWPORT's own rectangle — **REQ-123** |
  | Paper | the **sheet** — `(0,0)` to `sheetWidthIn() × sheetHeightIn()` |

  Paper space frames the sheet rather than the paper entities on it: the page is the meaningful
  extent of a layout, and a layout with no geometry yet must still frame to something. Paper
  geometry drawn **outside** the sheet is therefore not framed by this gesture — a stated
  limitation, not an oversight.

  **Middle-drag pan is untouched.** REQ-045 guarantees it, and a double-click is not a drag; the
  two gestures do not overlap.
- Acceptance:
  - a middle double-click over the model viewport frames the drawing, identically to `ZOOMEXTENTS`;
  - it works **while a command is active**, and the command's state survives it — a `LINE` with one
    point placed still has that point and still expects the next;
  - the typed route still does **not** zoom mid-command, and its behaviour is unchanged: while a
    command is active, typed text is consumed by that command, so `ZOOMEXTENTS` is read as point
    input and refused by it (`"Could not parse point…"`). `StartZoomExtentsCommand`'s own
    "finish or cancel the active command first" guard is not even reached on that path — it
    applies when the text does reach the dispatcher. Either way the transparency is a property of
    the **gesture** alone, and nothing about the typed command is relaxed;
  - in paper space the gesture frames the sheet;
  - in floating model space it frames the model;
  - middle-drag pan still pans, in every space, unchanged;
  - a double-click with nothing to frame reports it and changes no view (REQ-201).
- Owner-layer: UI (the gesture) — the extents computation and the camera write are existing Commands code
- Status: accepted (2026-08-25). This REQ covers only #88's "Middle Mouse"/"Architecture"
  acceptance sections; #88's "ZOOMEXTENTS" section (margin, aspect-ratio, degenerate/empty extents,
  NaN safety) exercised the pre-existing framing path unmodified and untested here (D-2026-08-26-b)
  and is now **REQ-122**, which closes the issue alongside this one. The camera write named here as
  `ApplyViewportZoomToWorldRect` is `zoomframing::FrameWorldRect` since REQ-122
- Corrected 2026-08-26 (D-2026-08-26-e, REQ-123): the floating-model-space claim above was never
  true. The gesture was raised inside a block guarded by `!routeZoomToViewport`, which is skipped
  whenever a floating viewport owns pan/zoom — so a middle double-click through an activated viewport
  did nothing at all, and the typed command wrote the SHEET camera (GitHub issue #100). REQ-123 owns
  that case now; this requirement keeps the gesture and the model/paper branches.
- Revisions: 2026-08-25 — accepted (D-2026-08-25-o, relabeled D-2026-08-26-a while merging PR #93
  into `beta` — that letter was already taken by REQ-119 above); asked for directly by the user,
  from AutoCAD's wheel double-click.

### REQ-121 — Object selection is a visibly distinct mode: no OSNAP, a pickbox cursor, one prompt (GitHub issue #91)
- Purpose: "pick a point" and "pick an object" are different acts, and today they look and behave
  identically. A user in a selection step sees the same crosshair, sees snap markers that mean
  nothing there, and reads a differently-worded prompt in every command. The snapping is not merely
  useless during selection — it is actively misleading, because the cursor visibly jumps to a snap
  point while the hit-test uses somewhere else
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: An **object-selection step** is any command phase whose question is *which objects*
  rather than *which point*: the `PickSelection` phase of MOVE, COPY, SCALE, ROTATE, MIRROR, ALIGN,
  ARRAY and STRETCH, and the entity-picking loops of DELETE, JOIN, TRIM, EXTEND, LENGTHEN, BREAK,
  FILLET and CHAMFER.

  **ZOOM is excluded, and #91 lists it.** Saying so explicitly because dropping it silently would
  look like an oversight: ZOOM WINDOW's box picks a **region of the view** to fit, not objects.
  Nothing is selected by it, so "select objects" would be a prompt that lies, and a pickbox cursor
  would say *click a thing* while the user drags a rectangle. Its corners already come from
  unsnapped coordinates, so rule (1) would change nothing there either. The test is what the click
  is *for*, not whether it happens to drag a box.

  **Idle selection — no command running — is deliberately NOT one**, and is untouched by this
  requirement: it keeps today's crosshair and today's OSNAP behaviour. The reason is that the three
  rules below are a *mode signal*, and a mode signal is only meaningful against a default. Idle is
  that default — it is what the user is looking at most of the time — so making it look like a
  selection step would leave the pickbox meaning nothing, and would change the appearance of normal
  use to fix a problem that only exists inside commands. The distinction being drawn is "a command
  is asking me which objects" versus "nothing is running", which is exactly the line this excludes.

  Three rules hold for the whole duration of such a step, and stop holding the moment the phase
  advances.

  **(1) OSNAP has no effect.** The distinction that matters here is that the *hit-test* is already
  mostly correct and the *cursor* is not:

  | | today | required |
  |---|---|---|
  | what the pick hit-tests against | raw unsnapped cursor, for most steps | raw unsnapped cursor, for **every** step |
  | where the cursor is drawn | snapped — it jumps to snap points | raw — it tracks the mouse |
  | snap markers / tooltips | drawn | not drawn |

  So this is only half a behaviour change. `ViewportUseRawWorldForSelectionRectPick` and the
  `RawEntityPick` route already establish "hit-test raw" for selection rectangles and entity picks
  respectively — the `RawEntityPick` comment already gives this requirement's own reasoning, that
  *"an OSNAP-adjusted point would hit-test somewhere the user is not pointing."* What does not
  exist is any suppression of the snap **cursor adjustment or marker display**, so the user watches
  the crosshair leap to an endpoint while the pick correctly ignores it. Making the rule explicit
  is what stops it from being a per-command accident.

  **The rule also closes a live inconsistency it exposes.** `ALIGN` routes its `PickSelection`
  phase to `SelectionAccumulate` alongside its six siblings, but is **absent** from
  `ViewportUseRawWorldForSelectionRectPick` — so ALIGN's selection-box corners come from *snapped*
  coordinates while MOVE/COPY/SCALE/ROTATE/MIRROR/ARRAY's come from raw. That is a defect, found
  while writing this requirement, and it is precisely the "per-command accident" a stated rule
  prevents. A single predicate answering *"is a selection step active?"* is what all three rules
  below consult, so a command cannot be half-included again.

  **"No effect" includes the one-shot OVERRIDE.** Shift+Right-click opens a "snap once — choose
  type" menu, and picking from it forces a snap on the next pick. That is a way of *asking* for the
  behaviour this rule removes, so the menu does not open during a selection step, and an override
  armed just before one began is not spent inside it either (added 2026-08-26, D-2026-08-26-d: the
  first implementation gated only the automatic snap, leaving the rule true for every snap except a
  deliberately forced one).

  **(2) The cursor is a pickbox.** A square of the size the crosshair configuration already carries
  (`pickbox half-size in px`, an existing setting — this is not a new tunable), replacing the
  crosshair for the duration of the step and reverting when it ends. This is AutoCAD's `PICKBOX`
  convention and the visual signal that rules (1) and (3) are in force.

  **(3) One prompt — for the steps that are nothing but a selection.** The wording is
  **"Select objects, ENTER to continue"**, settled once in one shared string and shown in both the
  command line and the dynamic cursor text (REQ-304's surfaces, and REQ-304's rule that the two
  agree). Today those prompts range from "click two corners to window-select objects" to
  "window-select entities, then press Enter" to no Enter hint at all.

  It applies to the steps whose whole content is *pick objects*: **MOVE, COPY, SCALE, ROTATE,
  MIRROR, ALIGN, ARRAY, DELETE, JOIN**.

  **DELETE and JOIN had to earn that prompt, and the behaviour moved rather than the words**
  (2026-08-26, D-2026-08-26-d). Both were fixed two-click-box commands: the box acted the moment it
  closed, and Enter was answered with *"finish window-select in the viewport (two clicks)"*. The
  shared prompt told the user to press a key the command explicitly refused, which made rule (3) a
  sentence rather than a rule. They now take the click-or-box, accumulate-until-Enter shape
  D-2026-08-25-l gave the seven transform commands — that decision excluded only STRETCH, for a
  stated reason, and simply never included these two. Adding a second, box-only prompt was the
  alternative and was declined: it would have made "one prompt, everywhere" mean "one of two
  prompts", to preserve behaviour nobody had chosen.

  **It does NOT replace a prompt that carries a keyword or a type list**, and that limit is
  load-bearing rather than a concession. TRIM's selection prompt offers `type L — draw the trim
  line`; OFFSET's names what is pickable; STRETCH's says `right-to-left = crossing`, which is
  operative because its box direction is data (REQ-103 step 5). Overwriting those with a generic
  phrase would delete the only place each option is discoverable — and REQ-119 exists precisely to
  make such keywords *more* reachable, so this requirement must not quietly undo it. Those steps
  still get rules (1) and (2); only their prompt text is their own.

  Unifying wording is the goal; erasing information is not. Where a step has nothing to say beyond
  "pick objects", it says exactly the same thing as every other such step.
- Acceptance:
  - no snap marker is drawn, and the cursor does not jump to a snap candidate, at any point during
    any object-selection step listed above;
  - the pick that results is hit-tested against the raw cursor for **every** listed step —
    including ALIGN, whose box corners are snapped today;
  - the cursor renders as a pickbox square for the step's duration and reverts to the crosshair
    when the phase advances or the command is cancelled;
  - MOVE, COPY, SCALE, ROTATE, MIRROR, ALIGN, ARRAY, DELETE and JOIN each show the **identical**
    selection prompt in the command line **and** in the dynamic cursor text, sourced from one shared
    string — byte-for-byte the same, not merely equivalent wording;
  - TRIM, OFFSET and STRETCH keep their own prompts, and every keyword they name (`L`, the pickable
    type list, `right-to-left = crossing`) is still present afterwards — a prompt that lost an option
    to this requirement is a **failure** of it, not a tidy-up;
  - a command left out of the treatment is a **build-time or test-time** failure, not something a
    user finds — the single predicate is exhaustive over the phases, on the precedent of
    `ViewportClickRouteFor`'s `default:`-less switch (REQ-103/TASK-099);
  - the accumulate-until-Enter behaviour of REQ-305 is unchanged — this requirement governs the
    step's *appearance and input treatment*, never which objects it collects;
  - STRETCH keeps its crossing box as load-bearing geometry (REQ-103 step 5): it gets the cursor,
    snap and prompt treatment, and its box semantics are untouched;
  - **with no command running, nothing changes at all** — the crosshair is the crosshair, OSNAP
    behaves exactly as it does today, and snap markers still draw. A user who never starts a command
    cannot tell this requirement was implemented, and that is the intended outcome, not a gap;
  - the Shift+Right-click snap-override menu does not open during an object-selection step, and an
    override armed before the step began is not consumed inside it — verifiable as an A/B against a
    control, since the same gesture at the same pixel must still open the menu under a point step;
  - DELETE and JOIN accumulate objects by click **or** box until Enter, and Enter is what acts on
    the selection — a closing box no longer erases or joins, and Enter with nothing selected is a
    stated refusal that leaves the command running (REQ-201).
- Scope boundary — **model space and floating model space only** (stated 2026-08-26,
  D-2026-08-26-d). In PAPER space the modify commands are pick-first: `StartDeleteCommand` and its
  siblings act on an existing paper selection or answer *"select paper object(s) or viewport(s)
  first"* without ever setting `st.active`, so there is no object-selection **step** for the three
  rules to apply to — the selection itself is made idle, which this requirement excludes by decision.
  Paper space therefore keeps the crosshair and the ordinary OSNAP behaviour throughout. That is a
  consequence of two deliberate choices meeting, not an oversight in either; giving paper space the
  treatment means giving its modify commands a real selection phase, which is a behaviour change
  outside this requirement. Filed separately as GitHub issue #106 rather than absorbed here.

  seam added to rule (1), DELETE/JOIN's behaviour corrected so rule (3) is true for them, and the
  paper-space scope boundary stated rather than left to be discovered.

### REQ-307 — Paper-space MOVE/COPY/DELETE gain a real selection step when nothing is pre-selected (GitHub issue #106)
- Purpose: REQ-121 gave model space a visibly distinct "picking objects" mode — no OSNAP, a pickbox
  cursor, one shared prompt — for every object-selection step, but stated paper space as an explicit
  scope boundary rather than an oversight: `StartDeleteCommand`/`StartPaperMoveCopyViewports` are
  **pick-first** (act on whatever idle click/box-select has already selected, or refuse), so there
  was no selection *step* in paper space for REQ-121's three rules to attach to. This requirement is
  what REQ-121's own scope-boundary text names as the fix — "giving paper-space modify commands a
  real selection phase" — for the one case that actually needed it: starting the command with
  **nothing** selected.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: Paper-space MOVE, COPY and DELETE keep pick-first as the fast path — starting one with
  an existing paper-entity or viewport selection acts immediately, exactly as today. Starting one
  with **nothing** selected no longer answers a flat refusal ("select paper object(s) or viewport(s)
  first." / "select object(s) first."); it opens a real selection step instead, with the identical
  input treatment REQ-121 gives its model-space counterpart:

  1. **A click toggles one object (paper entity or viewport) into the accumulating selection, no
     Shift required, and a window/crossing box merges into it rather than replacing it** — the
     paper-space analog of REQ-305's model-space accumulate-until-Enter shape (D-2026-08-25-l). The
     object universe is the same one idle click/box-select already reaches in paper space (REQ-035
     viewports + REQ-037 native geometry); this adds a second entry point onto it, not a new
     eligibility rule.
  2. **Enter is what advances the step** — to MOVE/COPY's base-point phase, or straight to DELETE's
     erase — and Enter with nothing selected is REQ-201's stated refusal ("Nothing selected — click
     objects or drag a selection window, then press Enter."), leaving the step open rather than
     exiting the command.
  3. **OSNAP has no effect and the cursor is a pickbox for the step's duration**, the same two rules
     REQ-121 states for model space, reusing the same predicates (`ViewportIsObjectSelectionStep` is
     model-space-only by its own doc comment, so this adds a paper-space counterpart,
     `PaperIsObjectSelectionStep`, consulted alongside it everywhere REQ-121's rules are drawn —
     pickbox cursor, the pre-existing paper snap-glyph suppression, and the shared prompt).
  4. **The same shared prompt REQ-121 defines** (`kSelectObjectsPrompt`, "Select objects, ENTER to
     continue | ESC cancel") is shown in both the command line and the dynamic cursor text, exactly
     as its model-space counterparts show it — reusing the string rather than declaring a
     paper-space-specific one.

  ESC cancels the step (clearing the new state, leaving any partial selection intact — the same
  behaviour REQ-121's model-space PickSelection cancellation already has, since `CancelActiveCommand`
  never clears `st.selection` either).
- Acceptance:
  - starting DELETE, MOVE or COPY in paper space with an existing selection is byte-identical to
    today — this requirement adds a second path, it does not touch the first;
  - starting DELETE, MOVE or COPY in paper space with nothing selected opens a selection step and
    logs the same wording model-space's own MOVE/COPY/DELETE use for their PickSelection phase
    ("... click objects or drag a selection window (Enter when done) ..."), not the old refusal;
  - a click during the step toggles one object into the selection without Shift, and Shift+click
    removes it — matching REQ-305's model-space accumulate shape;
  - a window/crossing box during the step MERGES into the accumulating selection rather than
    replacing it;
  - Enter with a non-empty selection advances the step (to base-point for MOVE/COPY, or straight to
    the erase for DELETE) and Enter with an empty selection is REQ-201's refusal, leaving the step
    running;
  - no snap marker is drawn and the cursor does not jump to a snap candidate at any point during the
    step (the pre-existing paper-space snap glyph, which is not gated on any command today, is
    suppressed for this step specifically);
  - the cursor renders as a pickbox square for the step's duration and reverts to the ordinary
    crosshair when the step ends (advances or is cancelled);
  - the command-line prompt and the dynamic cursor text agree, both showing REQ-121's own
    `kSelectObjectsPrompt` string, byte-for-byte;
  - ESC cancels the step without crashing or leaving stale internal state that a later MOVE/COPY/
    DELETE in the same session would trip over.
- Scope boundary — **this requirement covers only DELETE, MOVE and COPY**, the only paper-space
  commands that were pick-first before it (REQ-035 viewports, REQ-037 native geometry). Paper space
  has no ROTATE/SCALE/MIRROR/ALIGN/ARRAY equivalent of MOVE/COPY's own pick-first branch to extend —
  those paper-space commands are invoked only from an existing selection today, unchanged by this
  requirement. Extending the same treatment to a future paper-space command is a new decision, not
  an omission of this one.
- Owner-layer: UI (the ambient paper-space click/box/Enter handling in `CadUi.cpp`, the pickbox
  cursor and snap-glyph suppression, the dynamic-cursor palette's engagement gate); Commands
  (`StartPaperMoveCopyViewports`/`StartDeleteCommand`'s new branch, the shared
  `ProcessPaperMoveWaitingSelectionEnter`/`ProcessPaperDeleteWaitingSelectionEnter` functions,
  `PaperIsObjectSelectionStep`)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-26)
- Revisions: 2026-08-26 — accepted (D-2026-08-26-g), TASK-120; GitHub issue #106, split from #91
  during REQ-121's own review.

### REQ-308 — Start screen tab
- Purpose: GoSurvey launches straight into a blank "Drawing 1" with no landing surface for
  reopening recent work, reaching the project website, or seeing sign-in state. Every CAD-class
  tool has a start page and users expect one. This adds a persistent first tab that serves that
  role without disturbing the tab/document model or the REQ-091 launch sign-in gate.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A **"Start" tab** is the first tab in the drawing tab bar (index 0), selected on
  launch, and **cannot be closed or dragged behind another tab**. It is not a drawing: it owns no
  document, geometry, layers, or viewport, and is skipped by save-on-switch, dirty-tab
  enumeration, and the close path. The first real drawing remains **"Drawing 1"** and sits
  immediately after Start; File > New, the tab bar's "+", and File > Open all create/append
  drawings after Start and focus them (REQ-055 is unchanged for drawing tabs).

  The Start tab's content is three columns:

  1. **Left** — the title **"GoSurvey <version>"** (the running build's `GOSURVEY_VERSION_FULL`,
     ADR-029 (a)), an **Open…** button (same action as File > Open) and a **New** button (same as
     File > New), and a text link reading **"Visit The Website"** (the URL itself is not shown) that
     opens **https://chetjones003.github.io/GoSurvey** in the system browser. There is **no**
     "Autodesk Projects" and **no** "Learning & Insights" entry.
  2. **Middle** — **"Recent"**: a list of recently opened drawings, each with a **thumbnail**, the
     drawing name, and its last-opened date. It offers a **grid view and a list view**, a **sort
     control** (at least Last Opened and Name), and a **search box** that filters by name. Clicking
     an entry opens that drawing in a new focused tab (a missing file logs REQ-201-style and is
     offered for removal from the list). A drawing's thumbnail is **captured when it is saved or
     opened**; an entry with no captured thumbnail shows the **default DWG file icon**.
  3. **Right** — **"Connect"**: when signed in, **"Welcome <name>"** and the account email, exactly
     as the Settings panel shows today. When **not signed in** (only reachable when the launch gate
     was skipped for lack of any network — REQ-091 as amended), a short offline notice and a
     **"Sign In"** button that starts the existing interactive sign-in flow
     (`cmd.authSignInRequested`). Below that, a **"Help Me Improve This Product"** section with a
     **"Send Feedback"** button that opens
     **https://github.com/chetjones003/GoSurvey/issues** in the system browser.

  The recent-drawings list persists across sessions in a new user-scoped store
  (`gosurvey-recent.json`, D-2026-08-30-b); a missing or corrupt store yields an empty list, never
  an error. Thumbnails are cached BMPs under the user data directory with a bounded, LRU-evicted
  size (D-2026-08-30-c).

  **Full-bleed.** While the Start tab is active the docked Properties, Reports and Toolspace panels
  and the command line are not shown, so the Start screen fills the whole work area. Switching to
  (or opening) a drawing restores those panels and the command line to their layout positions.
- Acceptance:
  - fresh launch: the tab bar reads **"Start"** then **"Drawing 1"**, with Start active and the
    Start content (not a viewport) shown;
  - the Start tab has no close button and cannot be closed by any path; with Start + one drawing
    open, the drawing is still closeable;
  - File > New / "+" append "Drawing N" **after** Start and focus it; File > Open does likewise;
  - the left column shows "GoSurvey " followed by the exact `GOSURVEY_VERSION_FULL` string, an
    Open… and a New button that invoke the same actions as the File menu items, and a "Visit The
    Website" link (no URL text) that opens `https://chetjones003.github.io/GoSurvey` in the browser;
  - with the Start tab active, the Properties, Reports and Toolspace panels and the command line are
    not visible; opening a drawing or switching to a drawing tab brings them all back in place;
  - no "Autodesk Projects" or "Learning & Insights" text appears anywhere on the tab;
  - save a drawing, relaunch: it is listed under Recent with a bitmap thumbnail of its last view;
  - a recent entry whose thumbnail was never captured shows the DWG file icon, not a broken image;
  - Recent offers a grid view, a list view, a sort control, and a search box that filters the list
    by typed text;
  - clicking a recent entry opens that drawing in a new tab which becomes the active tab;
  - a recent entry pointing at a now-missing file does not crash and reports the miss;
  - signed in: the right column reads "Welcome <name>" with the account email;
  - not signed in (simulated): the right column shows the offline notice and a Sign In button that
    sets `cmd.authSignInRequested`;
  - a deleted/corrupt `gosurvey-recent.json` results in an empty Recent list and a normal launch.
- Owner-layer: UI (`CadUi_StartScreen.cpp`, the tab bar's Start-tab special-casing in `CadUi.cpp`,
  the viewport-vs-start branch in `DrawDrawingViewport`); IO (`RecentDrawings` store, capture hook
  in the save/open paths); Platform (`ThumbnailCache` FBO readback + BMP encode, `ShellExecuteA`
  URL open — already used by `auth`)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-30)
- Revisions: 2026-08-30 — accepted (D-2026-08-30-a/b/c). Start tab as a non-document sentinel at
  index 0 (architecture §11.5 amended); new `gosurvey-recent.json` MRU store; thumbnail capture
  from the drawing `ViewportRenderer` FBO stored as BMP (in-tree writer, no new dependency).

### REQ-309 — Selectable view projection: orthographic and perspective (GitHub issue #144)
- Purpose: REQ-058 built a camera that already implements both projections — `Camera::Projection`,
  `fovDeg`, and the perspective branches of `WorldToScreen` and `ScreenRay` are all present and
  correct — but **nothing in the application ever selects perspective**. No code path assigns
  `Camera::projection`, no command reaches it, and `.gs` does not persist it. The projection a
  drawing is viewed with is therefore fixed at orthographic for the life of the product, and
  GitHub issue #120's acceptance condition "Perspective view works" cannot be met. This
  requirement makes the existing capability reachable, persistent and testable; it does not add
  projection maths.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: The model viewport's **projection is a user-selectable per-drawing view property**
  with two values, **Orthographic (the default) and Perspective**, plus a perspective **field of
  view** in degrees. A `PERSPECTIVE` command reports the current projection when given no
  argument and sets it when given one, following the shape `VS` (REQ-064) already established for
  visual style; `FOV` reports and sets the field of view. Both are reachable from the View ribbon
  beside the existing visual-style control.

  Projection is a property of **how the drawing is looked at, never of the drawing itself**: no
  stored coordinate changes when it is switched, which is the same rule REQ-154 states for the
  UCS. Switching to perspective and back returns the view to its previous appearance.

  Picking, object snapping and every overlay position must remain correct under perspective.
  `ScreenRay` builds a **diverging ray from an eye point** there, where the orthographic case
  builds parallel rays differing only in origin, so every consumer of `ScreenRay` and
  `WorldToScreen` is affected — this is the same class of breakage REQ-058's own acceptance
  captured with "every entity type, not only lines".

  Projection and field of view persist in `.gs` for the model viewport and for **named views**
  (REQ-106), which already carry the camera's azimuth and elevation and would otherwise restore a
  perspective view as orthographic. A legacy `.gs` carrying neither field loads as orthographic
  with the default field of view and renders identically to pre-change.

  **Orthographic remains the default everywhere** — at startup, for a new drawing, and for any
  file that does not say otherwise — so REQ-058's "plan view renders pixel-comparable to the
  pre-change build" is untouched.
- Acceptance:
  - `PERSPECTIVE` with no argument reports the current projection; with an argument it sets it,
    and an unrecognised argument is refused with the projection unchanged (REQ-201);
  - `FOV` reports and sets the field of view, and a non-finite or out-of-range value is refused
    with the value unchanged (REQ-201);
  - switching orthographic → perspective → orthographic leaves every stored coordinate untouched
    and returns the view to its prior appearance;
  - a point projected by `WorldToScreen` under perspective round-trips through `ScreenRay` back
    to the same world point within REQ-101;
  - object snapping resolves to the correct world coordinates under perspective, verified against
    hand-computed values within REQ-101;
  - projection and field of view survive `.gs` save/reopen for the model viewport;
  - a named view saved in perspective restores in perspective, with its field of view;
  - a legacy `.gs` with neither field loads as orthographic at the default field of view;
  - the REQ-100 frame budget is met while orbiting in perspective.
- Owner-layer: Commands (`PERSPECTIVE` / `FOV`, `CadViewCamera`, per-drawing state), UI (View
  ribbon control), IO (`.gs` model viewport + named views)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-31)
- Revisions: 2026-08-31 — initial. Raised by the GitHub issue #120 Phase 1 audit, which found the
  projection maths complete and unreachable. Paper-space per-viewport projection is **explicitly
  out of scope**: REQ-061's per-viewport camera is not implemented at all — `Viewport`
  (`PaperSpace.hpp`) carries no camera orientation — so a projection field there would have
  nothing to compose with. Recorded as a distinct gap, not folded in here.

### REQ-310 — 3D crosshair cursor showing the UCS axes (GitHub issue #144)
- Purpose: once the camera can orbit (REQ-058) and the UCS can be rotated (REQ-154), a
  screen-aligned crosshair stops describing the drawing. Its two arms are always horizontal and
  vertical on screen no matter which way the work plane runs, so the cursor gives the user no cue
  where a typed X or Y will actually go — the one piece of feedback that matters most while
  drawing in a tilted view. AutoCAD solves this with a 3D crosshair whose arms are the active
  UCS's axes; this is that.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: The model-space cursor has a **3D mode** in which its arms are the **active UCS's X,
  Y and Z axes projected into the current view**, replacing the two screen-aligned arms. The axes
  are coloured by the near-universal CAD convention — **X red, Y green, Z blue** — using the same
  values as the REQ-154 UCS icon, so the two indicators can never disagree about which axis is
  which. Each axis is drawn as a full line through the cursor centre, gapped around the pickbox.

  The arms **foreshorten with the view**: an axis pointing at the viewer collapses, and below a
  small pixel threshold it is not drawn at all — its absence is the cue that it points out of the
  screen. In plan view with the world UCS this means two arms, X to screen-right and Y to
  screen-up, which is how every existing drawing has always been read.

  The mode is **off by default** and is toggled by a `CROSSHAIR3D` command (reporting when given
  no argument, setting when given one) and by a checkbox beside the other crosshair settings. It
  persists in `.gs`.

  **Model space only.** A paper sheet is 2D by definition (ADR-009/013), so there is no frame
  there for the axes to describe and the cursor stays the standard crosshair. The REQ-121
  object-selection **pickbox rule still wins**: during a selection step the cursor is the box
  alone, with no arms, in either mode.

  The projection is pure geometry, computable without a graphics context, for the same reason
  `Camera` is (ADR-002): an arm drawn along the wrong screen direction still looks like a 3D
  cursor, so the sign conventions need a test that does not depend on a window.
- Acceptance:
  - `CROSSHAIR3D` with no argument reports the current mode; with an argument it sets it, and an
    unrecognised argument is refused with the mode unchanged (REQ-201);
  - in plan view with the world UCS, the X arm projects to screen-right and the Y arm to
    screen-up, at equal length;
  - under a UCS rotated 90° about Z, the arms follow the UCS and not the world;
  - orbiting rotates the triad with the camera, and the X and Y arms stay perpendicular on screen
    through a full azimuth sweep;
  - tilting off plan makes the Z arm appear pointing up the screen, and foreshortens the arm that
    tips away from the viewer;
  - an axis pointing at the viewer is not drawn, and plan view — where Z does exactly that — is
    still treated as a valid 3D crosshair rather than falling back;
  - a degenerate frame falls back to the standard crosshair rather than leaving no cursor;
  - the mode survives `.gs` save/reopen, **including OFF** — a file saved with it off must turn it
    off when opened from a session that had it on;
  - the setting changes no stored coordinate;
  - with the mode off, the cursor is unchanged from before this requirement.
- Owner-layer: viewport (`Crosshair3d.hpp`, pure projection), UI (`CadUi.cpp` draw,
  `CadUiSettings.cpp` checkbox), Commands (`CROSSHAIR3D`), IO (`.gs` setting)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-31)
- Revisions: 2026-08-31 — initial. Requested by the user during the issue #144 work, with an
  AutoCAD reference screenshot. Axis LABELS in the crosshair (AutoCAD's "Label axes in crosshairs"
  option) are deliberately **not** included: the reference image has them off, and they are

### REQ-122 — ZOOMEXTENTS frames the drawing safely: margin, aspect, degenerate extents, no invalid camera (GitHub issue #88)
- Purpose: REQ-120 gave the middle double-click its gesture and reused the existing framing path
  untouched, which left the larger half of issue #88 — everything the framing itself promises —
  asserted but never checked (D-2026-08-26-b). Checking it found one guarantee that does not hold:
  a drawing with no extent (a single point, coincident objects, a hair-length line) frames at a
  zoom around 4.6e6, a view a fifth of a thousandth of a unit tall, which is not a view of anything
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: **Framing a world rectangle onto the camera is one shared operation with four
  guarantees.** It is the same operation for `ZOOMEXTENTS`/`ZE`, for REQ-120's middle double-click,
  for `ZOOMWINDOW`/`ZW` and for the post-import fit — issue #88's Architecture section requires that
  the command and the gesture cannot disagree, so there is one implementation and no second copy of
  the arithmetic.

  **(1) It fits, centred, with a margin.** The camera centres on the rectangle's midpoint, and the
  binding axis leaves `8%` of the viewport free — half of it on each of that axis's two sides — so
  geometry never touches an edge. Which axis binds is decided by the **viewport's aspect ratio**,
  which is what keeps the other axis un-clipped rather than assuming a square viewport.

  **(2) A degenerate rectangle still frames to something a user can work in.** Below a **minimum
  framed span of one world unit** on either axis, the rectangle is expanded about its own centre to
  that minimum. One unit is 1% of the view the application opens with (`zoom == 1` shows 100 units),
  so a point, a pair of coincident objects, or a drawing measured in thousandths frames near — but
  still tighter than — the default view, instead of at a magnification where the camera's own float
  precision is the largest thing on screen.

  The floor is **shared by `ZOOMWINDOW`**, deliberately and not as a side effect: the same "never
  zoom to an unusable scale" guarantee applies to a window the user drags to nothing, and splitting
  the rule per caller would be the second copy of the arithmetic this requirement exists to prevent.
  Its cost is stated rather than hidden — no view can be framed tighter than one world unit tall.

  **(3) A rectangle that is not finite frames nothing.** A NaN or infinite bound, or a bound pair
  whose difference overflows, is **refused**: the camera is not written at all, so the previous view
  survives intact and no NaN can reach it. The refusal states its reason (REQ-201). This is the only
  way "invalid camera values are never produced" can be guaranteed — a clamp still writes a wrong
  number.

  **(4) Nothing to frame is not a failure.** An empty drawing produces no extents, and the caller
  says so and changes no view — the behaviour REQ-120 already relies on, now stated.

  **What counts as the drawing's extents is unchanged.** `ComputeRobustWorldExtents` and its
  far-outlier rejection keep deciding that, in model and floating model space; paper space frames
  the sheet (REQ-120). This requirement governs the **camera**, never the entity sweep.
- Acceptance:
  - the camera centres on the extents rectangle, and the whole rectangle is inside the visible
    rectangle at any viewport aspect — wide, square or tall;
  - the binding axis leaves exactly 8% of the viewport free and the other axis at least that much,
    so no geometry touches an edge;
  - a single point, coincident objects, a zero-height row and a hair-length line each produce a view
    at least the minimum framed span across, centred on the content — not a magnification at float
    precision;
  - a drawing larger than the minimum span is framed exactly as before: the floor is invisible above
    it;
  - a non-finite bound, or a span that overflows to infinity, writes **no** camera value and leaves
    the current view untouched, with a stated reason;
  - every accepted rectangle produces finite `pan`/`zoom` values, across spans from `1e-9` to `1e12`
    and aspects from `0.05` to `20`;
  - a rectangle given with its corners in either order frames identically (`ZOOMWINDOW`'s corners
    arrive in drag order);
  - typed `ZOOMEXTENTS` and REQ-120's middle double-click produce the **same** camera, because they
    call the same function;
  - middle-drag pan is unchanged (REQ-045), and two middle drags in succession are two pans, not a
    double-click.
- Owner-layer: Commands (the framing arithmetic and the callers that consume it). No UI change —
  REQ-120 already owns the gesture
- Status: accepted (2026-08-26); closes the remainder of GitHub issue #88 alongside REQ-120
- Revisions: 2026-08-26 — accepted (D-2026-08-26-c); raised by chetjones003 on issue #88 after PR #93
  merged, asking for #88's ZOOMEXTENTS acceptance list to be verified rather than assumed.

### REQ-123 — ZOOM EXTENTS through an activated viewport frames the model into that viewport (GitHub issue #100)
- Purpose: a floating viewport is the model-space window the user is actually working in, and
  zoom-extents was the one navigation operation that did not know it. It wrote the sheet camera and
  left the viewport's framing untouched, so the layout zoomed around a viewport that never moved
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: **While a paper-space viewport is activated (floating model space) and the viewport zoom
  lock is OFF, `ZOOMEXTENTS` — typed, or by REQ-120's middle double-click — frames the model into
  that viewport.** It writes the viewport's own `modelCenterX/Y` and `scaleModelPerPaperIn`, and
  writes **no** screen camera: the viewport keeps its size and position on the sheet, and the sheet's
  own pan/zoom is untouched.

  **The viewport's aspect is its rectangle on the sheet**, `paperWIn : paperHIn` — not the
  application window's. That single substitution is the defect: the same drawing framed with the
  window's aspect over-fills one axis of the viewport and leaves the other empty.

  **It is the same framing operation as everywhere else.** REQ-122's `FrameWorldRect` decides the
  centre, the margin, which axis binds, the minimum span and the refusal on a non-finite rectangle;
  this converts that answer into the viewport's units (model units per paper inch). Issue #88's
  Architecture section requires one framing implementation, and this does not add a second.

  **The extents are the model seen THROUGH that viewport.** An entity whose layer is frozen in the
  viewport (REQ-028 / REQ-046) is not part of what the user is looking at, so it does not drag the
  framing out to reach it — the same test the viewport renderer and the plotter already apply. The
  filter is on **visibility**, not on entity kind: the viewport renderer currently draws only lines,
  polylines, circles, arcs and survey points, and that is a renderer limitation, not a statement
  about what a drawing contains. Encoding it here would freeze a gap into the extents math.

  **The zoom lock decides which view is being navigated.** `viewportZoomLocked` already means
  "pan/zoom targets the sheet"; zoom-extents is a zoom, so with the lock **ON** a floating viewport
  frames the **sheet**, exactly as paper space does. Only the lock-OFF case — the default, and the
  one where the wheel and middle-drag already target the viewport — frames into the viewport.

  **REQ-120's floating-model-space claim is corrected here.** It stated that the middle double-click
  frames the model in floating model space. It did not: the gesture was raised inside a block guarded
  by `!routeZoomToViewport`, which is skipped whenever a floating viewport owns pan/zoom, so it never
  fired there at all. The flag is now raised in every space, and this requirement decides what
  "extents" means for each.
- Acceptance:
  - with a viewport activated and the lock off, `ZOOMEXTENTS` centres that viewport on the model
    extents and sets its scale so they fit its rectangle, with REQ-122's margin;
  - the viewport's position and size on the sheet are unchanged, and the sheet's own pan/zoom is
    unchanged — the operation writes nothing outside the viewport;
  - the framing is computed from the viewport's own aspect, so the **same drawing in two viewports of
    different shapes gets two different scales**;
  - the sheet, the viewport border and paper-space geometry are not in the calculation;
  - an entity on a layer frozen in that viewport does not affect the result, and the same entity in a
    viewport where its layer is thawed does;
  - REQ-120's middle double-click produces the same result as the typed command, in a viewport as in
    model space;
  - middle-drag pan continues to move the model within the viewport and nothing else (REQ-045);
  - with **no** viewport activated, paper space frames the sheet exactly as REQ-120 specifies;
  - with the zoom lock ON, a floating viewport frames the sheet;
  - it is covered by a **transcript**, not only by a manual pass — see Owner-layer.
- Owner-layer: Commands (the framing and the extents filter); UI (raising REQ-120's gesture in every
  space). Notably **not** blocked by TASK-113's DEBT-1: the viewport case needs no framebuffer,
  because its aspect comes from paper inches and its framing is stored on the viewport, so it is
  handled ahead of `ProcessPendingViewportZoom`'s `fbW <= 0` guard and is the first zoom behaviour a
  headless transcript can drive end to end
- Status: accepted (2026-08-26); closes GitHub issue #100
- Revisions: 2026-08-26 — accepted (D-2026-08-26-e); reported by chetjones003 as issue #100.

### REQ-124 — Empty named TIN surface (GitHub issue #119)
- Purpose: let the user create the surface object first and add data afterwards, matching Civil 3D
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `SURFACECREATE <name>` with no point groups, and the Surface Manager's New Surface
  action, create a named drawing-owned surface whose triangulation is **null**. Duplicate names are
  refused (REQ-075). Adding sources later rebuilds as REQ-069. A create that *names* groups which
  cannot triangulate still **creates the object** and reports why there is no TIN (REQ-201) — it
  does not leave a bogus triangle set. Hover, SURFELEV, OSNAP and zoom-extents skip a null TIN.
- Acceptance:
  - `SURFACECREATE Empty` adds one surface; `SURFACELIST` reports it as not built; triangle count 0;
  - creating a surface from groups that resolve to fewer than three non-collinear points still adds
    the named surface, logs a specific message, and leaves `tin` null;
  - the empty surface round-trips `.gs` (name, empty definition, no verts/indices);
  - `SURFELEV` on a drawing that contains only an empty surface reports outside / no elevation, and
    does not crash.
- Owner-layer: Domain, Commands, UI, IO
- Status: accepted (2026-08-27)
- Revisions: 2026-08-27 — initial (D-2026-08-27-a).

### REQ-125 — Surface statistics
- Purpose: the numbers a surveyor reads off a surface without running a volume comparison
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A pure `util/surfacestats` module reports, from a triangulation: point count, triangle
  count, plan extents (min/max easting and northing), elevation min/max, 2D area (sum of triangle
  plan areas), 3D area (sum of triangle face areas), and slope min / max / mean (percent grade of
  each triangle's plane, area-weighted for the mean, excluding degenerates). `SURFACESTATS [<name>]`
  prints them; omit the name to list every surface. An empty / null TIN reports zeros and says it is
  not built. Statistics are **not persisted**.
- Acceptance:
  - a 100×100 square planar pad at z=10 reports 2D area 10,000 and 3D area 10,000 within REQ-101;
  - a 100×100 pad at 100% grade (rise=run) reports 3D area 100×100×√2 within REQ-101;
  - a null TIN reports not-built rather than inventing numbers;
  - `SURFACESTATS` names a missing surface rather than printing another surface's figures.
- Owner-layer: util, Commands, UI
- Status: accepted (2026-08-27)
- Revisions: 2026-08-27 — initial (D-2026-08-27-a).

### REQ-126 — Indexed surface elevation queries
- Purpose: SURFELEV, rollover, OSNAP and volumes must not scan every triangle on a REQ-100 surface
- Priority: must
- Type: performance / functional
- Statement: Elevation at XY uses `TinElevationAtIndexed` through a live-only spatial index cached on
  `AppCommandState` (ADR-039 (c)). The index is rebuilt when the TIN pointer changes. Indexed and
  full-scan answers agree, including misses, concave notches, and hide-boundary voids. Large
  coordinates (state-plane magnitude) stay within REQ-101 of the triangle plane.
- Acceptance:
  - for a committed fixture, indexed and scan elevations match within REQ-101 at interior samples
    and both miss the same exterior / notch / void samples;
  - a query against a null TIN is a miss;
  - SURFELEV and REQ-089 rollover use the indexed path (one walk, as today).
- Owner-layer: util (`tinbuild` / `surfacevolume` index), Commands (cache)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-27)
- Revisions: 2026-08-27 — initial (D-2026-08-27-a).

### REQ-127 — Surface elevation object snap
- Purpose: pick a point *on the ground* while drawing, not only on triangle vertices
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A new object-snap kind interpolates the covering visible surface's triangle plane at the
  cursor's plan position and returns XYZ. If several surfaces cover the point, the **topmost in the
  drawing's surface list** wins (last-created if appended) — stated, not guessed. A miss, a null TIN,
  or an invisible surface produces no snap. Running OSNAP has an independent toggle, default **on**.
- Acceptance:
  - on the REQ-074 test plane, a snap at a known interior XY returns that plane's Z within REQ-101;
  - a cursor outside every surface produces no surface snap;
  - with the toggle off, no surface snap is offered.
- Owner-layer: Viewport (CadSnap), Commands, UI
- Status: accepted (2026-08-27)
- Revisions: 2026-08-27 — initial (D-2026-08-27-a).

### REQ-128 — Data-clip surface boundary
- Purpose: keep shots *outside* a site from pulling the TIN, which outer-cull after the fact cannot
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `CadBoundaryKind::Clip` / `TinBoundaryKind::Clip`. If a surface has one or more clip
  rings, an input point is used **only if it lies inside at least one clip** (union). Clip rings are
  constrained edges. After the build, triangles whose centroids fall outside every clip are culled
  (same centroid rule as Outer). Hide/show still apply in definition order among themselves. No clip
  present means "do not filter points". `DESIGNATEBOUNDARY` accepts CLIP. Legacy `.gs` without the
  kind string still loads as outer/hide/show.
- Acceptance:
  - points outside a clip do not appear as TIN vertices; a point inside does;
  - two clips union: a point inside either is used;
  - a clip round-trips `.gs` as `"clip"`;
  - an unclosed polyline is refused as a clip (same as other boundary kinds).
- Owner-layer: util (tinbuild), Domain, Commands, IO
- Status: accepted (2026-08-27)
- Revisions: 2026-08-27 — initial (D-2026-08-27-a).

### REQ-129 — Contour geometry as a surface data source
- Purpose: build or densify a surface from existing contour polylines without treating them as
  ordinary breaklines in the Manager tree
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: A surface definition may list **contour sources** by stable entity id (line, polyline,
  3D polyline, feature line). Each vertex and each segment is a triangulation constraint at the
  entity's stored Z. They rebuild dynamically like breaklines (REQ-069). Display contours remain
  style-generated (REQ-070); this is input, not EXTRACT. `DESIGNATECONTOUR` / `UNDESIGNATE … CONTOUR`
  and a Surface Manager Contours node. Additive `.gs` array, omitted when empty.
- Acceptance:
  - a closed 3D polyline at z=100 around a pad forces TIN edges along it at z=100;
  - deleting the polyline drops it from the definition and rebuilds;
  - a drawing without the array loads unchanged.
- Owner-layer: Domain, Commands, UI, IO
- Status: accepted (2026-08-27)
- Revisions: 2026-08-27 — initial (D-2026-08-27-a).

### REQ-130 — Direction / aspect banding
- Purpose: colour triangles by downhill azimuth — drainage aspect, not just grade
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: `SurfaceAnalysisMode::Direction` uses the style's existing band table in **degrees**.
  Aspect is downhill azimuth: 0 = +Y (northing), increasing toward +X (easting), in [0, 360). A
  flat or degenerate triangle (REQ-072's flat-grade test) is unbanded, not assigned an arbitrary
  compass. `.gs` stores mode 3. A pre-REQ-130 file with mode 0/1/2 is unchanged.
- Acceptance:
  - a plane that falls due east (+X) bands into the range that contains 90°;
  - a plane that falls due north (+Y) bands into the range that contains 0°;
  - a flat triangle is unbanded;
  - switching mode to None restores the plain style display.

### REQ-131 — Bounded volumes
- Purpose: earthwork inside a site boundary, not the whole overlapping hull
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: Volume comparison (REQ-073) may be limited to a closed polyline in plan. Sample cells
  whose centres fall outside the ring contribute neither volume nor common area. `VOLUMES <base>,
  <comparison>[, <clip entity>]` and a dashboard clip picker. No new surface type. Analytical check:
  two planar surfaces 5 ft apart over a 1-acre clip report 21,780 ft³ (806.67 yd³) cut or fill
  according to which is higher, within a stated relative tolerance of 1%.
- Acceptance:
  - the 5 ft × 1 acre fixture matches 21,780 ft³ within 1%;
  - a clip that misses both surfaces reports zero and says there is no overlap inside the clip;
  - omitting the clip preserves today's full-overlap behaviour.
- Owner-layer: util (surfacevolume), Commands, UI
- Status: accepted (2026-08-27)
- Revisions: 2026-08-27 — initial (D-2026-08-27-a). **Phase 2 — not in the first implementation
  increment.**

### REQ-132 — Watershed analysis
- Purpose: name the drainage basins on a TIN
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A pure `util/watershed` module, given a TIN, produces drain targets (boundary, internal
  depression, or flat) and a per-triangle basin id, plus each basin's plan area. Display is
  style-generated cache geometry, not entities, not stored in `.gs`. `WATERSHED <surface>` reports
  counts; the Surface Manager can inspect a basin. Algorithm and termination rules (flats, pits)
  are specified in the task that implements this REQ, with synthetic fixtures: single basin, two
  basins, ridge, saddle, boundary drain, internal depression.
- Acceptance:
  - the synthetic single-basin fixture yields one basin draining to the designed target;
  - the two-basin / ridge fixture yields two basins that do not cross the ridge;
  - an internal depression is classified as such, not silently merged into a neighbour;
  - a null TIN is refused with a specific message.
- Owner-layer: util, Commands, Renderer, UI
- Status: accepted (2026-08-27)
- Revisions: 2026-08-27 — initial (D-2026-08-27-a). **Phase 3.**

### REQ-133 — Water-drop path
- Purpose: trace where water goes from a picked point
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `WATERDROP` picks a plan position on a surface, finds elevation (REQ-074/126), and
  traces downhill across triangle planes until a REQ-132 drain target. The path is previewed as 3D
  geometry and may be baked to an unlinked 3D polyline (EXTRACT pattern). A start outside the
  surface is refused (no extrapolation).
- Acceptance:
  - on a constant-grade plane the path is a straight downhill line to the designed boundary;
  - a start in a designed pit terminates at that pit;
  - a start outside the TIN reports outside and draws nothing.
- Owner-layer: util, Commands, UI
- Status: accepted (2026-08-27)
- Revisions: 2026-08-27 — initial (D-2026-08-27-a). **Phase 3; depends on REQ-132.**

### REQ-134 — Catchment from an outlet
- Purpose: the contributing area upstream of a structure
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement: `CATCHMENT` picks an outlet on a surface and reports the upstream triangle set's plan
  area, elevation min/max, and a display boundary (cache geometry, optional EXTRACT bake). Uses the
  REQ-132 drain graph in reverse. An outlet outside the TIN is refused.
- Acceptance:
  - an outlet at a designed basin pour-point reports that basin's area within REQ-101 of the
    synthetic fixture;
  - an outlet on a ridge that drains both ways reports the union of contributing triangles, or a
    stated split rule documented in the implementing task — not a silent half;
  - a null TIN / miss is a named refusal.
- Owner-layer: util, Commands, UI
- Status: accepted (2026-08-27)
- Revisions: 2026-08-27 — initial (D-2026-08-27-a). **Phase 3; depends on REQ-132.**

### REQ-135 — Surfaces in paper-space viewports and PDF plot
- Purpose: a surface that exists in the model must appear where the user looks at the model
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: Display-geometry batches already built for model space (contours, border, triangles,
  bands, arrows) are drawn through paper-space viewports subject to the same layer / VP-freeze /
  non-plottable rules as other model entities, and are stroked by `PdfPlot` on plot. No second
  contour engine. A surface on a non-plottable layer is omitted from the PDF and the omission is
  not silent if the export log already names excluded kinds — plot skip follows layer plottable
  the way other entities do (REQ-068).
- Acceptance:
  - a floating viewport whose layer freeze does not hide the surface shows its contours (manual
    GUI; paper overlay path);
  - PLOT of a layout that sees the surface includes contour/border strokes in the PDF;
  - a surface on a non-plottable layer does not appear in the PDF.
- Owner-layer: UI (viewport overlay), IO (PdfPlot), Renderer
- Status: accepted (2026-08-27)
- Revisions: 2026-08-27 — initial (D-2026-08-27-a). Closes the TASK-085 DEBT-1 / roadmap "Surface
  plotting" gap.

### REQ-136 — TIN volume surface from two TINs
- Purpose: a surface whose elevations are the difference between two existing TINs, so cut/fill
  can be contoured, styled, and queried like any other surface
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: The user can create a named `CadSurface` whose definition is two other TIN surfaces
  (base and comparison, by name). Its triangulation is derived: at each unique plan vertex of
  either parent that both TINs cover, Z is **comparison minus base**. Those points are
  unconstrained Delaunay (same `BuildTin` as REQ-068). Grid and corridor kinds are REQ-137, not this
  object's job.
  Parents that are themselves volume surfaces are refused. Missing names, identical parents, or
  no overlapping samples are named refusals (REQ-201). The object rebuilds when a parent TIN is
  replaced (REQ-069 dirty). `.gs` stores the two names plus the derived verts/indices like any
  other surface. `VOLUMESURFACE <name>, <base>, <comparison>` and Surface Manager "New volume
  surface…". REQ-073 `VOLUMES` remains the numeric cut/fill report; this requirement does not
  replace it.
- Acceptance:
  - two planar TINs 5 ft apart over the same square produce a volume TIN whose vertex Z values
    are 5 ft within REQ-101;
  - two TINs with no plan overlap refuse with a specific message and add no usable triangulation;
  - a missing parent name is a named refusal;
  - the created object appears in SURFACELIST as a volume surface naming both parents.

- Status: accepted (2026-08-27)
- Revisions: 2026-08-27 — initial (D-2026-08-27-b). 2026-08-28 — D-2026-08-28-a: drop the
  "no ISurface / no grid" sentence; those kinds are REQ-137.

### REQ-137 — Surface kinds and shared query interface (GitHub issue #119)
- Purpose: TIN, grid, grid-volume, and corridor surfaces share elevation / slope / aspect queries
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `CadSurface` carries a `SurfaceKind` (`Tin`, `Grid`, `TinVolume`, `GridVolume`,
  `Corridor`). Query and analysis go through `ISurfaceQuery` in `util/` with **two implementations**
  (TIN triangle interpolation and grid bilinear — REQ-301). Corridor surfaces build a TIN from
  designated feature-line vertices. Grid surfaces store origin, spacing, column/row counts and Z
  samples; they also produce a display TIN (two triangles per cell). Grid-volume Z is comparison
  minus base at shared nodes. `SURFACECREATE` accepts an optional kind; `SURFACECREATEGRID` /
  `SURFACECREATECORR` name the other kinds. Missing data yields a named empty surface (REQ-124).
- Acceptance:
  - a 2×2 grid with known corner Z interpolates the cell centre within REQ-101;
  - a TIN query and `ISurfaceQuery` on the same TIN agree within REQ-101;
  - a corridor surface with no feature lines is named and not built;
  - a grid-volume with no overlapping nodes is a named refusal.

### REQ-138 — Contour extras, slope angle, and XY aspect (issue #119)
- Purpose: user-defined contour elevations, Chaikin smoothing, contour labels, slope in degrees,
  query slope/aspect at a plan point
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A style may list extra contour elevations, a Chaikin pass count (0–5) on **display**
  contours, and a label spacing in feet along major contours (0 = off). Labels are live overlay
  text, not entities. `SurfaceAnalysisMode::SlopeAngle` bands by `atan(grade/100)` in degrees.
  `SURFELEV` reports elevation, percent grade, slope angle, and aspect degrees (or "outside").
- Acceptance:
  - a user elevation appears in the generated contour level list;
  - smoothing with passes > 0 increases vertex count of an open contour;
  - labels are omitted when spacing is 0;
  - a due-east plane reports aspect 90° and a non-zero slope angle;
  - a miss reports outside and does not invent a slope.
- Owner-layer: util, Commands, UI
- Status: accepted (2026-08-28)

### REQ-139 — Masks and TIN edge swap (issue #119)
- Purpose: mask rings exclude area from calculations; swapped edges survive rebuild
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `CadBoundaryKind::Mask` is a closed polyline that hides triangles (same cull as Hide)
  and is listed under Masks in the Surface Manager. `SURFSWAPEDGE <surface>, <x>, <y>` records an
  interior edge flip in the definition; rebuild reapplies flips to a new `shared_ptr<const CadTin>`.
  A pick that is not on an interior edge is a named refusal.
- Acceptance:
  - a mask removes triangles from area stats versus the unmasked twin;
  - a successful swap changes two triangle index triples and survives SURFACEREBUILD;
  - a miss pick does not mutate the TIN.
- Owner-layer: util, Domain, Commands, UI, IO
- Status: accepted (2026-08-28)

### REQ-140 — Volume MTEXT report and extended statistics (issue #119)
- Purpose: put cut/fill on the sheet; TIN and volume-surface stats match the issue
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `VOLREPORT` inserts an MTEXT of the last successful `VOLUMES` / dashboard cut, fill,
  net (yd³) and common area (ft²). `SURFACESTATS` adds min/max triangle area, unique edge count,
  breakline-edge count, min/max/mean slope in **degrees**, and for a volume surface the integrated
  positive/negative Z (cut/fill) over the difference TIN.
- Acceptance:
  - VOLREPORT with no prior volume result is a named refusal and adds no entity;
  - after VOLUMES, VOLREPORT increases the annotation count by one;
  - stats on a 1-triangle surface report that triangle's area as min and max.

### REQ-141 — Analyze ribbon and water-drop feature line (issue #119)
- Purpose: the issue's Analyze tools are reachable from the Survey ribbon; a drop can be a feature line
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: The Survey ribbon tab chrome matches Civil 3D's Survey tab (D-2026-08-28-k):
  Labels & Tables, General Tools (no Object Viewer), Survey (Toolspace), Modify, Analyze, Launch Pad.
  Unimplemented Civil 3D tools are disabled with a **not implemented yet** tooltip (REQ-084).
  Implemented actions: Add Tables (`VOLREPORT` / `VOLREPORT TABLE`), Properties, Isolate Objects,
  Survey Toolspace (`TOOLSPACE`), Survey Point Properties, Edit Elevations (feature-line elevations),
  Quick Profile, Create Surface. Surfaces, volume create, breaklines, elevations, slopes, watershed,
  water drop, catchment, dashboard, VOLREPORT, statistics, and rebuild remain invokable from the
  command line; the TIN Surface contextual tab (REQ-143) also exposes the surface Analyze/Modify set.
  `WATERDROP EXTRACT FL` bakes the last path as a feature line (unlinked).
- Acceptance:
  - each named command remains invokable from the command line;
  - EXTRACT FL with a path adds one feature line; with no path is a named refusal.
- Owner-layer: UI, Commands
- Status: accepted (2026-08-28)

### REQ-142 — Toolspace (Prospector and Settings)
- Purpose: a drawing explorer whose chrome matches Civil 3D Toolspace, listing only objects GoSurvey implements
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A dockable **TOOLSPACE** window has a dark title, a view combo, a light
  tree, a right-edge pair of **readable** vertical tabs (**Prospector**, **Settings**), and an empty
  preview strip. There is **no** decorative toolbar (D-2026-08-28-m). Tree labels use Segoe UI when
  installed (else the app UI font), near-black ink on off-white paper, and darker hierarchy lines. Prospector is rooted at the active drawing name and lists Points (light context menu:
  Create, Import, Export, Edit, Select, Zoom to, Pan to), Point Groups, Surfaces, and Feature Lines.
  Left-click on a **collection** folder does nothing; right-click shows that collection's Civil 3D
  command list, with unimplemented items **disabled**. Named point groups, surfaces, and feature lines
  are children of those folders. Left-click does not open editors; right-click menus do (Style and
  Analysis on a named surface, Properties on a named group or feature line). Hierarchy uses thin grey
  tree lines. Definition add/remove is on the expanded surface tree (Masks, Watersheds, Definition: Boundaries,
  Breaklines, Contours, Point Files, Point Groups, Edits). Folders Civil 3D shows that GoSurvey does
  not implement (DEM Files, Drawing Objects, Alignments, …) stay **absent**. Settings
  lists only implemented style tables: General (Text Styles, Layers, Dimension Style) and Surface
  (Surface Styles). The panel reads existing stores; it does not invent document types. `TOOLSPACE`
  opens it; `TOOLSPACE SETTINGS` / `PROSPECTOR` switch tabs; `TOOLSPACE LIST` prints the tree;
  `TOOLSPACE CLOSE` hides it. An unknown verb is a named refusal.
- Acceptance:
  - `TOOLSPACE LIST` on an empty drawing names Points, Point Groups, Surfaces, and Feature Lines and
    does not name Alignments, Pipe Networks, or Parcel;
  - after creating a named surface and a named point group, `LIST` includes those names plus
    Definition, Masks, and Watersheds, and does not name DEM Files;
  - `TOOLSPACE SETTINGS` then `LIST` names Text Styles and Surface Styles and does not name Parcel
    or Grading;
  - `TOOLSPACE NOSUCH` is a named refusal and does not change the tab.
- Owner-layer: UI, Commands
- Status: accepted (2026-08-28)
- Revisions: 2026-08-28 — D-2026-08-28-c: collection left-click, Civil 3D menus, definition from tree.
  2026-08-28 — D-2026-08-28-m: omit dummy toolbar; Segoe UI tree face; stronger text/line contrast.

### REQ-143 — Contextual TIN Surface ribbon tab
- Purpose: Civil 3D-shaped tools appear when a surface is selected, without inventing unimplemented objects
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: When at least one `SelectedEntity::Type::Surface` is selected in model space (or floating model space), the ribbon tab strip gains a contextual tab titled `Tin Surface: <surface name>` (the first selected surface). Selecting a surface the first time in a stretch switches to that tab; deselecting restores the previous permanent tab only if the contextual tab is still active. The tab contains the screenshot panels **Labels & Tables**, **General Tools**, **Modify**, **Level of Detail**, **Analyze**, **Surface Tools**, and **Launch Pad**. Implemented actions target that selected surface: Properties (side Properties panel), Inquiry (`SURFELEV`), Isolate Objects (`ISOLATEOBJECTS` / `HIDEOBJECTS` / `UNISOLATEOBJECTS`), Surface Properties, Add Data (breakline / contour / boundary designate), Edit Surface (`SURFACEADDPOINT`, `SURFACEDELPOINT`, `SURFSWAPEDGE`, `SURFACEREBUILD`), Water Drop, Catchment, Volumes Dashboard, Extract (`EXTRACT`, `WATERDROP EXTRACT`, `WATERDROP EXTRACT FL`, `CATCHMENT EXTRACT`). **Object Viewer is omitted** (D-2026-08-28-f): the 3D viewport is the viewer. Other controls with no GoSurvey command are **disabled** and their tooltip includes **not implemented yet**. REQ-084 still forbids a disabled control from acting. The contextual tab index is not a persisted prefs slot (`kRibbonTabCount` stays the permanent tabs).
- Acceptance:
  - with no surface selected, the tab strip does not include a `Tin Surface:` tab;
  - selecting a named surface shows a tab whose label contains that surface's name;
  - `SURFELEV`, `WATERDROP`, `CATCHMENT`, `SURFACEREBUILD`, and `EXTRACT` remain invokable from the command line (this tab does not replace them);
  - unimplemented buttons on the tab cannot be activated (disabled);
  - Object Viewer is not present on the tab.

### REQ-144 — Add and delete TIN definition points (issue #119)
- Purpose: a TIN can gain or lose vertices without mutating the live triangulation pointer
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `CadSurface` stores `addedPointXyz` (local XYZ, stride 3) and `deletedPointPicks`
  (local XY). `SURFACEADDPOINT <surface>[, <x>, <y>, <z>]` appends an add (name-only starts a pick
  at the work-plane elevation). `SURFACEDELPOINT <surface>[, <x>, <y>]` appends a delete pick
  (name-only starts a pick). `ResolveSurfaceInputs` appends added points after groups and files,
  then for each delete pick removes the nearest remaining input point. Rebuild replaces
  `shared_ptr<const CadTin>` (architecture §11.5). Non-TIN kinds and a delete on a surface with no
  assembled points are named refusals (REQ-201). Both lists persist in `.gs`.
- Acceptance:
  - four added corners on an empty TIN rebuild to 4 points;
  - deleting the nearest corner then rebuilding yields 3 points;
  - `SURFACEADDPOINT` on a grid surface is a named refusal and adds no vertex;
  - a missing surface name is a named refusal.

### REQ-145 — Quick Profile along two plan points (no alignments)
- Purpose: inspect a surface as a station/elevation graph without Alignment or Profile entities
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `QUICKPROFILE <surface>[, <x1>, <y1>, <x2>, <y2>]` samples the named surface along the
  plan segment using `ISurfaceQuery::elevationAt` (existing TIN and grid implementations). Name-only
  starts a two-point pick. Samples include both endpoints, step 1 ft, at most 4096 points. Hits and
  misses are stored; a line with no on-surface sample is a named refusal (REQ-201). Zero-length and
  missing/unbuilt surfaces are named refusals. The graph is **session UI**, never written to `.gs`
  and not a document entity. Alignments and Civil 3D Profile / Profile View objects are out of scope.
- Acceptance:
  - on a plane Z = X, the sample at the midpoint of (0,0)–(10,0) is 5 within REQ-101;
  - a segment that misses the surface is a named refusal and does not invent elevations;
  - a zero-length segment is a named refusal;
  - `QUICKPROFILE` remains invokable from the command line (the ribbon does not replace it).

### REQ-146 — Cut area and fill area (issue #119 AC-V5)
- Purpose: volume reports name the plan area of cut separately from fill
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `ComputeSurfaceVolume` accumulates `cutAreaFt2` (Base above Comparison) and
  `fillAreaFt2` (Comparison above Base) alongside cut/fill/net volumes and common area.
  `VOLUMES`, the Volume Dashboard, `VOLREPORT`, and `VOLCSV` print both areas.
- Acceptance:
  - two planar TINs 10 ft apart over a 100×100 square report cut area 10,000 ft² and fill area 0
    (or the reverse when the pair is swapped);
  - a report with no prior volume result still refuses `VOLREPORT` without adding an entity.

### REQ-147 — Mixed-sign volume cells split on the zero contour (issue #119 AC-V6)
- Purpose: cut and fill are not collapsed when two surfaces cross inside a sample cell
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: Each volume sample cell queries both TINs at its four corners. A cell whose ΔZ does not
  change sign integrates as a prism. A mixed-sign cell splits each half-triangle on the ΔZ = 0
  contour and accumulates cut and fill separately. The 250,000-sample budget remains. Corner misses
  fall back to a centre sample.
- Acceptance:
  - Base Z = X and Comparison Z = 5 over [0,10]×[0,10] report cut volume and fill volume each 125 ft³
    within 5%, and cut/fill areas each 50 ft² within 5%.

### REQ-148 — Drawing TABLE for volume summaries
- Purpose: volume numbers can sit in the drawing as an AutoCAD-style table, not only as MTEXT
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A TABLE is a first-class entity (`CadTable` in `cadTables` / `cadTableAttrs`,
  `EntityKind::Table` appended after Surface). It stores insertion (top-left of the unrotated table),
  width, height, rotation, column count, and row-major `cells`. MOVE, COPY, ROTATE, SCALE, MIRROR,
  STRETCH, ARRAY, and ALIGN apply to the whole table. Double-clicking a cell opens an in-place editor
  (Enter commits, Esc cancels). `.gs` round-trips a `"tables"` array. Load migrates leftover
  `CadAnnotation::Kind::Table` into `cadTables`. The viewport and paper overlay stroke the grid and
  cell text.   `VOLREPORT TABLE` (alias `VOLTABLE`) inserts a 2-column table of the last volume result
  (and dashboard rows when present). The grid auto-fits cell text (`CadTableFitToContent`):
  equal columns, height from row count × text height; insert and each committed cell edit
  refit. `VOLREPORT` with no argument still inserts MTEXT (REQ-140). DXF
  export emits cell TEXT (no ACAD_TABLE object).
- Acceptance:
  - `VOLREPORT TABLE` after `VOLUMES` adds one TABLE entity (not an annotation);
  - a TABLE with 2 columns and 4 cells lays out four non-empty rectangles inside its box;
  - `VOLREPORT TABLE` with no volume result is a named refusal;
  - MOVE of a TABLE changes its insertion; a cell hit-test returns the row-major index of a point
    inside that cell;
  - `CadTableFitToContent` makes `width` at least as wide as the longest cell string at the
    table's plotted height, and `height` at least one text-height per row; a longer cell
    string after a fit increases `width`.

### REQ-149 — Multi-row Volume Dashboard and CSV
- Purpose: several base/comparison/clip analyses share one dashboard and one export
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: The Volume Dashboard keeps a list of named analysis rows (`VOLDASH ADD <label>` snapshots
  the current pick and result). The live pickers remain the working row. `VOLCSV <path>` writes a UTF-8
  CSV of every row plus the live result: label, base, comparison, cut, fill, net, cut area, fill area,
  common area. Missing path opens the existing CSV save dialog.
- Acceptance:
  - `VOLDASH ADD` with a landed result increases the row count by one;
  - `VOLCSV` with no volume data is a named refusal;
  - `VOLCSV tests/tmp-vol.csv` after `VOLUMES` writes a file containing `cut`.

### REQ-150 — Move TIN point and delete TIN line
- Purpose: the issue's remaining TIN edits are definition operations, like REQ-144
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `SURFACEMOVEPOINT <surface>[, <x1>, <y1>, <x2>, <y2>, <z2>]` records a local from-XY and
  to-XYZ; rebuild replaces the nearest assembled point. Name-only is two picks (from, then to; to-Z is
  the work plane). `SURFDELLINE <surface>[, <x>, <y>]` records a pick; rebuild deletes the two
  triangles of the nearest interior edge (`TinDeleteInteriorEdgeNear`). Live `CadTin` is never mutated
  except via pointer swap after a copied mesh edit. Grid/corridor/volume kinds refuse.
- Acceptance:
  - moving the only extra add-point of a three-point TIN relocates that vertex after rebuild;
  - deleting an interior edge of a two-triangle quad leaves fewer than six indices;
  - a miss more than 1 ft from any interior edge is a named refusal.

### REQ-151 — Arcs as surface breaklines
- Purpose: 3D geometry used as breaklines includes arcs
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `ResolveDefinitionChain` tessellates a `CadArc` into at least 8 chords (≤1 ft or 5°
  whichever is finer, cap 256) at the arc's Z, and treats that chain as an open breakline. Closed
  boundaries still require a polyline or feature line.
- Acceptance:
  - designating an arc as a breakline rebuilds the TIN with a constraint along the chord chain;
  - `DESIGNATEBOUNDARY` on an arc is a named refusal.

### REQ-152 — Catchment mean elevation
- Purpose: catchment elevation statistics include an average, not only min/max
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `CatchmentResult::meanZ` is the area-weighted mean of triangle vertex elevations in the
  catchment. `CATCHMENT` logs it with min/max.
- Acceptance:
  - a planar catchment reports mean Z equal to that plane within REQ-101;
  - an outside pick still reports outside and does not invent a mean.

### REQ-153 — Contextual SURVEY Point(s) ribbon tab
- Purpose: Civil 3D-shaped tools appear when survey points are selected, without inventing unimplemented COGO objects
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: When `selectedSurveyPointIndices` contains at least one valid survey-point index in model space (or floating model space), the ribbon tab strip gains a contextual tab. One valid selected point: title `SURVEY Point: <point id>`. More than one: title `SURVEY Points`. First selection in a stretch switches to that tab **unless** the TIN Surface contextual tab is already active (both tabs stay visible). Deselecting the last point restores the previous permanent tab, or the TIN Surface tab if a surface is still selected. Panels match the screenshots: **Labels & Tables** (single) / **Tables** (multi) with Add Tables; **Edit Label Text** only when one point is selected; **General Tools** (Inquiry, Properties, Isolate Objects — **no Object Viewer**); **Modify**; **Analyze**; **SURVEY Point Tools**; **Launch Pad**. Wired actions: Inquiry (`ID`), Properties, Isolate Objects, Edit/List Points (`VIEWPOINTS`), Point Group Properties (Point Groups window), Import Points, Export Points, Create Points, Create Point Group, Create Surface. Unimplemented Civil 3D leftovers (Add Tables as a point table, Edit Label Text, Renumber, Datum, Elevations from Surface, Lock/Unlock Points, Geodetic Calculator, Transfer Points) are **disabled** and tooltip **not implemented yet**. The tab index is not a persisted prefs slot (`kRibbonTabCount` stays the permanent tabs).
- Acceptance:
  - with no survey point selected, the tab strip does not include a `SURVEY Point` tab;
  - selecting one survey point shows `SURVEY Point:` plus that point's id;
  - selecting more than one survey point shows `SURVEY Points`;
  - Object Viewer is not present on the tab;
  - unimplemented buttons on the tab cannot be activated (disabled);
  - `CREATEPOINTS`, `VIEWPOINTS`, `IMPORTPOINTS`, `EXPORTPOINTS`, and `ID` remain invokable from the command line.

### REQ-154 — UCS and PLAN: a real coordinate-system service (GitHub issue #126)
- Purpose: give the user a coordinate frame to work in, and a way to look at it, without ever moving
  the drawing. Until now `UCS` was an alias for `ELEV`: it could raise the work plane but had no
  axes, so nothing could ask "which way is UCS +X?" and every command read input in world terms
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A **User Coordinate System** is an origin plus a right-handed orthonormal basis,
  expressed in WCS and stored per drawing. It is the frame in which the user's input is read and in
  which coordinates are reported back.

  **A UCS never moves geometry.** Entities remain in WCS. Changing the UCS changes interpretation
  and presentation only; any code path that rewrites a stored coordinate because the frame changed
  is a defect.

  **One authoritative implementation.** `WorldToUcs` / `UcsToWorld` and their vector forms live in a
  single pure module (`src/util/ucs.hpp`, beside `util/ray3d` and for the same ADR-002 reason), and
  every consumer calls it. No command computes its own frame arithmetic.

  **`UCS` supports:** an origin alone (orientation preserved); origin + X-axis point; the three-point
  form (origin, +X, a point in the +Y half of the plane); `World`; `Previous` (a bounded history that
  a restore does not itself extend); `View`; `X` / `Y` / `Z` rotation about the UCS's **own** axes,
  positive by the right-hand rule; `ZAxis`; `Object`; and `Named`.

  **`Named` saves, and only saves.** `UCS N` asks for a name immediately - there is no
  Save / Restore / Delete question in front of it, because by the time a user has built a frame and
  typed `N` they have already answered it. `?` still lists at that prompt, and an existing name is
  redefined rather than duplicated. **Restoring and deleting a saved frame belong to the View
  Manager**, which lists them: choosing among saved frames needs to show what there is to choose
  from, and a command prompt can only ask the user to recall a name they cannot see. Both halves call
  one shared implementation, so the dialog and any other caller cannot drift apart. `World` is
  reserved: it can be neither redefined nor deleted. Named definitions persist with the drawing.

  **A rotation angle can be typed or measured.** At the `X` / `Y` / `Z` angle prompt, `2P` takes two
  points — typed or clicked — and uses the angle of the direction between them, measured in the plane
  that rotation spins and reported back so the user can see the number that was used. Feeding that
  angle to the rotation is what aligns the axis with the picked direction, so "square my frame to this
  lot line" is two picks rather than a bearing read off the drawing and typed back in. Two points that
  define no angle in that plane (coincident, or perpendicular to it) are refused and the prompt stands
  (REQ-201).

  **The command shows what it is about to do.** At the two axis prompts and at the second `2P` pick,
  a rubber preview runs from the origin to the cursor, and the cursor carries a **polar distance and
  angle pair** (REQ-024's stated exception) reading in the active frame. `@<distance><<angle>` is
  accepted as typed input at those prompts, so what the mouse produces is exactly what could have
  been typed.

  **A frame selector sits under the ViewCube**, in model space only. It names the active frame —
  `WCS`, the saved name when the frame is one of them, or `Unnamed` for a frame built but not saved —
  and opens a menu of `WCS`, every named UCS in the drawing, and `New UCS`. Selecting a name restores
  that frame; `New UCS` opens the ordinary command, so the menu and the command line cannot drift
  about what any of it means.

  **Coordinate entry is in the UCS.** Under a UCS rotated 45° about Z, `10,0` is ten units along the
  UCS X axis; `@dx,dy` is a delta along the UCS axes. Typed points accept `X,Y,Z` as well as `X,Y`,
  without which no tilted frame could be defined from the keyboard. Object snaps continue to resolve
  against real WCS geometry and return the snapped point's own position; the UCS transforms what is
  *reported* and what is *typed*, never what is *snapped to*.

  **A point carries its own elevation.** On a UCS parallel to world XY every point on the work plane
  shares one Z, which is why a single work-plane elevation sufficed before. A tilted UCS breaks that:
  the plane's Z varies across it. New geometry commits at the resolved point's own Z — the click's
  ray × plane intersection, or the typed UCS coordinate mapped through the frame.

  **ORTHO and the grid follow the UCS.** ORTHO squares to the UCS axes and stays in the UCS plane;
  the grid is generated in the frame's own XY. A drafting aid still squared to the world while entry
  has moved is worse than none — it reads as the drawing's alignment.

  **`PLAN` changes the view, never the UCS.** It orients the camera to the XY plane of the current
  UCS, the WCS, or a named UCS. Autodesk documents that distinction explicitly and it is the whole
  reason the command is separate. **`UCSFOLLOW`** (0/1, per drawing) makes a UCS change switch to a
  plan view of the new frame automatically.

  **A UCS icon** in the model viewport shows the active frame's X / Y / Z axes, foreshortened with
  the camera, with a `W` at its origin when the frame is the WCS. It is driven by the UCS state, not
  decoration.

  **Documented limitation — PLAN of a tilted UCS.** `Camera` stores azimuth and elevation with no
  roll axis, a deliberate choice (ADR-025 (c)) that avoids the pole flip a free eye/up pair suffers.
  For any UCS whose Z is world +Z — every translation, every rotation about Z, and so the whole 2D
  survey case — PLAN is exact: the UCS +Y comes out up the screen. For a **tilted** UCS the view
  *direction* is correct but the in-plane rotation cannot also be set, and the command says so when
  it happens. Making it exact requires adding roll to `Camera`, which is an architectural change
  (view matrix, `ScreenRay`, `WorldToScreen`, ViewCube, PDF plot, and new persisted per-tab state)
  and is deliberately **not** in this requirement.
- Acceptance:
  - the transform module is pure, orthonormal and right-handed by construction, and unit-tested
    including every refusal (collinear three-point, coincident picks, zero-length normal);
  - `WorldToUcs` and `UcsToWorld` invert each other exactly for translated, rotated and tilted
    frames;
  - every listed `UCS` option works, and each invalid input is refused with a stated reason rather
    than producing a degenerate frame (REQ-201);
  - `Previous` walks back through the history and a restore does not itself become a history entry;
  - named definitions save, restore, delete, list, and survive a `.gs` round trip byte-identically;
  - `World` cannot be saved over or deleted;
  - geometry drawn under a rotated UCS lands at the world coordinates the frame implies, asserted on
    actual stored coordinates rather than on entity counts;
  - geometry drawn on a **tilted** UCS commits at the elevation the plane gives at that point;
  - changing the UCS leaves every stored coordinate untouched;
  - the coordinate readout and `ID` report in the active UCS and name which frame that is;
  - ORTHO squares to the UCS axes; the grid is generated in the UCS plane;
  - `PLAN Current` / `World` / a named UCS orient the view and leave the UCS unchanged;
  - `UCSFOLLOW=0` preserves the view on a UCS change, `UCSFOLLOW=1` switches to a plan view of it;
  - the UCS is per drawing: switching tabs does not carry one drawing's frame into another, and a
    new drawing starts in the WCS with no saved frames;
  - a drawing saved before this requirement still loads, and a UCS that is a plain elevation change
    still writes the `ucsElevation` key an older build reads.
- Owner-layer: Commands (the frame, the commands, coordinate entry), Renderer (grid), UI (icon,
  readout), IO (`.gs` persistence)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-28)
- Revisions: 2026-08-28 — initial (D-2026-08-28-n); raised by chetjones003 as issue #126. 2026-08-29 — added `2P`
  to the rotation-angle prompt (take the angle from two picked points), at the user's request during
  hands-on testing of this branch. Same day — live axis preview, the polar
  distance/angle cursor pair (REQ-024's stated exception) with `@distance<angle` as typed input, and
  the frame selector under the ViewCube; all three requested from hands-on testing.

#### Not in this requirement — and why

Issue #126's acceptance list includes four items that cannot be honestly met, each blocked on a
capability that does not exist. They are recorded here rather than quietly dropped:

1. **Exact PLAN of a tilted UCS** — needs camera roll; see the documented limitation above.
2. **"Polar tracking follows the UCS"** — polar tracking does not exist. It is a status-bar toggle
   with no drafting behaviour (`CadUi.cpp`, labelled "UI only for now"). The condition asks for the
   feature to be built first, which is its own requirement.
3. **Per-viewport UCS and UCSFOLLOW isolation** (GitHub issue #155) — **promoted to its own
   requirement REQ-155** (accepted 2026-08-31, decision D-2026-08-31-c), once REQ-061's per-viewport
   camera (issue #175, 2026-08-31) removed the blocker. REQ-155 scopes the per-viewport *active UCS*
   to paper-space viewports and the floating model space (REQ-036) inside them; a viewport holds a
   `ucs::Ucs` frame value while named definitions stay shared on `ucsNamed`. Multiple simultaneous
   model-space viewports (`VPORTS` split) remain an explicitly open scope question and are **not**
   part of REQ-155.
4. **`Object` alignment to 3D faces, meshes, surfaces and solids** — resolving a face needs
   face-level picking, which does not exist: a mesh picks as one object with no face identity, and
   solids/surfaces as editable entities are issue #120's scope. `Object` covers lines, arcs,
   circles, ellipses and text, and refuses anything else with a stated reason.

### REQ-155 — Per-viewport active UCS and UCSFOLLOW (GitHub issue #155)
- Purpose: a paper-space viewport (and the floating model space inside it) resolves coordinate
  entry, the grid, ORTHO, the readout and UCSFOLLOW against its OWN active work plane, so two
  viewports on one sheet can present two different frames without leaking into each other or into
  the drawing's model view. Completes the per-viewport half of issue #126 / REQ-154, deferred there.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Statement:
  - Each paper-space `Viewport` carries an **active UCS frame** — a `ucs::Ucs` value, default the
    World Coordinate System. It is typically set to one of the drawing's named UCSs, but may also
    hold an ad-hoc frame built while floating inside that viewport (AutoCAD `UCSVP`). It is
    separate from the drawing-scoped `activeUcs`, which continues to govern the (single,
    non-floating) model-space view.
  - **Named UCS definitions and named views stay per drawing.** Only the *active frame* is per
    viewport; the shared `ucsNamed` list is the single owner of named definitions. `World` still
    cannot be saved over or deleted.
  - On entering **floating model space** (REQ-036) for a viewport, that viewport's active UCS
    selection becomes the frame that draw / edit / snap / the grid / ORTHO / the coordinate readout
    / `ID` all resolve against, and the readout names which frame that is (REQ-154). On leaving
    floating model space the drawing's model view is unchanged.
  - **`UCSFOLLOW=1`**: while floating model space is entered, changing that viewport's active UCS
    re-plans **only that viewport's camera** (REQ-061) to a plan view of the new frame; no other
    viewport and not the drawing's model view is re-planned or otherwise altered. `UCSFOLLOW`
    itself remains a single per-drawing flag (0/1).
  - Changing one viewport's active UCS **leaves every stored coordinate untouched** and leaves
    every other viewport's frame, camera and displayed geometry untouched (REQ-154's "changing the
    UCS leaves every stored coordinate untouched", scoped per viewport).
  - The per-viewport active UCS frame **persists per viewport in `.gs`** (origin + axes), additively (no
    `kGsFormatVersion` bump): a file written before this requirement loads with every viewport
    referring to the drawing's frame (unchanged behaviour), and a file written after it that an
    older build reads simply ignores the key.
  - **Out of scope:** multiple simultaneous model-space viewports (`VPORTS`-style split model
    space). Until that is a separate accepted requirement, the two-viewport acceptance below is
    satisfied by entering each viewport's floating model space in turn.
- Acceptance:
  - a layout with two viewports, viewport A's active UCS set to a rotated named UCS and viewport B
    left in World: entering A's floating model space and typing a point lands it at the world
    coordinates A's frame implies (asserted on the stored coordinate, not on entity counts);
    entering B's floating model space and typing the same relative input lands it at B's
    (World-frame) world coordinates;
  - with `UCSFOLLOW=1`, changing viewport A's active UCS while A's floating model space is entered
    re-plans A's camera to a plan of the new frame and leaves viewport B's camera, the drawing's
    model-view camera, and all stored geometry byte-identical;
  - changing viewport A's active UCS while nothing is floating changes no camera and no coordinate;
  - a pre-REQ-155 `.gs` loads with both viewports resolving against the drawing frame and renders
    identically to pre-change; a `.gs` saved after REQ-155 round-trips the per-viewport selection
    byte-identically and still carries every key an older build needs;
  - the coordinate readout inside a floating viewport names that viewport's frame (extends
    REQ-154's readout condition).
- Owner-layer: Commands (the per-viewport frame + coordinate entry + UCSFOLLOW re-plan), Renderer
  (grid in the viewport frame), UI (readout), IO (`.gs` persistence)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-31)
- Revisions: 2026-08-31 — initial (D-2026-08-31-c). Split from REQ-154 / GitHub issue #126 as the
  deferred per-viewport item; raised by TASK-157 after REQ-061 (issue #175) removed the blocker.


### REQ-311 — A plane is a coordinate frame, not a second type (GitHub issue #145)
- Purpose: issue #120 names a `Plane` abstraction — origin, normal, X axis, Y axis, converting both
  ways between world XYZ and plane 2D coordinates — as the prerequisite for faces, extrusions,
  revolves, booleans, sketches and arbitrary-plane drawing. `ucs::Ucs` (REQ-154) already **is** that
  shape: an origin plus a right-handed orthonormal basis, with world<->frame conversion for both
  points and vectors. What is missing is the 2D half of the contract and a written rule about which
  type owns it. Adding a parallel `Plane` type would create exactly the failure the requirement
  exists to prevent: two definitions of "plane" in one program, free to disagree about handedness,
  about which way a normal points, or about where a tilted circle starts — a disagreement that does
  not crash, it silently mis-places geometry (REQ-301, CLAUDE.md rule 2).
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: `ucs::Ucs` is the project's plane abstraction. It exposes conversion between world XYZ
  and the plane's own 2D coordinates in both directions, reports the off-plane component rather
  than discarding it, projects a world point onto the plane, and parametrises a circle in the
  plane. No second plane type is introduced. `ray3d::Plane` remains the origin+normal form used for
  ray/plane intersection; it carries no in-plane axes and therefore cannot express a 2D coordinate.

  The frame for a plane given only a normal comes from `ucs::FromNormal` — AutoCAD's Arbitrary Axis
  Algorithm, which is the algorithm DXF specifies for the group 210 extrusion vector. This is what
  makes REQ-312 round-trip: a consumer that rebuilds the frame from the normal alone lands on the
  same points GoSurvey drew.
- Acceptance:
  - World XYZ -> plane 2D -> world XYZ returns the original point. At survey magnitude on a plane
    tilted off every axis the error is within REQ-101, and in fact within 1e-9 — the conversion is
    `double` throughout, so a result that merely scraped under 0.01 ft would mean something had been
    narrowed to `float` on the way through.
  - The off-plane distance is an explicit output of the world->2D conversion, not a dropped
    component; it is positive on the +Z side of the frame.
  - Projecting a world point onto the plane leaves it at zero off-plane distance, and what was
    removed is exactly the normal component — the projection moves a point along the normal and in
    no other direction. A point already on the plane is unchanged.
  - A circle parametrised in the plane has every point at exactly the radius from the centre and at
    zero off-plane distance, including on a vertical plane — the case a flat-only store cannot
    represent at all. On the world frame it reduces to the familiar cos/sin.
  - The UCS uses this type. There is no second plane type and no parallel implementation of the
    conversion.
- Owner-layer: Domain (`src/util/ucs.hpp`)
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-31 — proposed and accepted (D-2026-08-31-e, TASK-159). Phase 2 of GitHub #120,
  filed as #145.

### REQ-312 — Arcs and circles in arbitrary planes (GitHub issue #145)
- Purpose: GoSurvey's arcs and circles are 2D entities that happen to carry a Z: `CadArc` stores a
  centre, radius and a single elevation, and a circle is four floats (cx, cy, z, r). Both are
  parallel to world XY by construction — `CadArc`'s own comment says so — so a circle standing on a
  wall, an arc in a vertical pipe run, or any curve drawn on a tilted UCS cannot be represented at
  all. The gap is also silently lossy on import: DXF's group 210 extrusion vector says which plane
  an ARC or CIRCLE lies in, and the importer does not read it, so a tilted arc arrives flat and in
  the wrong place with no warning (REQ-201).
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: An arc and a circle each carry a plane **normal** alongside their existing centre,
  radius and elevation. The normal is world +Z by default, which is every entity that exists today,
  and the flat case must stay behaviourally and byte-for-byte unchanged. A curve with any other
  normal lies in the plane `ucs::FromNormal(centre, normal)` (REQ-311), and that one frame governs
  how it is rendered, hit-tested, snapped to, saved and exported — a second derivation anywhere is
  a defect, not an optimisation.

  Authoring: `CIRCLE` and `ARC` run on the active UCS's work plane, so drawing on a tilted UCS
  produces a curve whose normal is that UCS's Z axis. This is the AutoCAD behaviour and needs no
  new command.

  Interchange: DXF export writes the real normal to group 210/220/230 instead of the hard-coded
  (0,0,1) it writes today, and DXF import reads it. `.gs` persists the normal, omitting the key
  when it is world +Z so that a legacy drawing re-saves byte-identically.
- Acceptance:
  - A circle created with a centre, a radius and an arbitrary normal renders in that plane and its
    points lie within REQ-101 of the true circle.
  - An arc created on a tilted UCS has endpoints within REQ-101 of the hand-computed positions.
  - Arbitrary-plane arcs and circles survive DXF export -> import with centre, radius, angles and
    normal preserved within REQ-101, via group 210.
  - Arbitrary-plane arcs and circles survive `.gs` save -> reopen with every stored coordinate
    bit-identical.
  - A drawing containing only XY-plane arcs and circles loads and re-saves **byte-identically** to
    its pre-change form: no normal key appears, and no existing test changes its expected output.
  - Object snapping resolves on an arbitrary-plane curve from an orbited camera, not only in plan
    view, for every snap mode GoSurvey has: Endpoint, Midpoint, Center, Perpendicular,
    Intersection, Apparent Intersection, Grip and Surface. Revised 2026-09-01 — this bullet first
    read "centre, quadrant, endpoint, nearest", and QUADRANT and NEAREST are not modes GoSurvey
    implements (`CadSnap::Kind` has never had them). Naming them here would have made the
    requirement unmeetable without adding two snap modes. No accepted requirement asks for
    them today, so they are a NEW requirement in the object-snap family, not a shortfall of
    this one; recorded here rather than silently dropped.
  - `docinvariants` checks the normal side-car against the entity count, so a desynchronised insert
    or erase fails loudly (REQ-204) rather than mis-orienting a curve.
- Owner-layer: Domain/Commands/Render/IO
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: 2026-08-31 — proposed and accepted (D-2026-08-31-f, TASK-159). Phase 2 of GitHub #120,
  filed as #145. 2026-09-01 — the object-snap acceptance bullet reworded to name the snap modes
  GoSurvey actually has; QUADRANT and NEAREST do not exist in `CadSnap::Kind` and belong to
  no accepted requirement at all, so the original wording could not be met without first
  writing a new one. 2026-09-01 — D-2026-09-01-c (GitHub issue #188): a tilted ARC's DXF
  `$EXTMIN/$EXTMAX` sweep now walks the arc from the centre a reader reconstructs (OCS point →
  six decimals → projected back) rather than the in-memory centre, so export → import → export
  reaches a byte-level fixed point at state-plane magnitude the way flat curves already did
  (REQ-204). No emitted coordinate, angle or normal changed; geometry was always well inside
  REQ-101. This closes the stability concern the `req312-dxf-arbitrary-plane-roundtrip` transcript
  had recorded as open.

### REQ-313 — The B-rep solid kernel and the seven primitive solids (GitHub issue #146)
- Purpose: GoSurvey has no solids. `CadMesh` (REQ-063 / ADR-026 (c)) is import-only reference
  geometry — no faces that mean anything, no edges, no volume — and `CadTin` is a surface, which by
  #120's own distinction encloses nothing. Everything in issue #120's Phases 4 to 6 (extrude,
  revolve, sweep, loft, boolean union/subtract/intersect, slice, fillet, chamfer, sectioning, mass
  properties) rests on a solid kernel that does not yet exist, and every one of them inherits
  whatever shape it takes. Issue #120 also states the constraint the kernel must satisfy: *"the
  geometry engine should be usable without a graphics context."*
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Statement: A boundary-representation solid kernel exists as a pure `util/` module — no GL, no
  ImGui, no document, no `AppCommandState` — carrying the hierarchy issue #146 names: solid ->
  shells -> faces -> loops -> edges -> vertices, with directed edge uses so a loop is an ordered
  ring of (edge, reversed) pairs.

  **Every face carries an analytic surface** (plane, cylinder, cone, sphere, torus) and every edge
  an analytic curve (line, arc); a whole sphere is one face. Volume and surface area are integrated
  in closed form over those surfaces, never summed from triangles, so the figures do not move when
  the display changes. Triangles are a **derived** representation produced on demand at a caller's
  chosen chord tolerance and never stored in the solid (#120: *"changing tessellation quality should
  not modify the underlying solid"*).

  A primitive additionally records the **recipe** it was built from — kind, placement frame,
  dimensions — for display and for future parametric regeneration. The recipe is never consulted by
  validity, mass properties or tessellation, all of which read the topology alone, and a solid may
  carry no recipe at all: that is the Phase 4 boolean result, and it is the case that establishes
  the topology and not the recipe as the stored truth.

  Seven primitives are constructible, each a true closed solid rather than a bag of surfaces:
  `BOX`, `WEDGE`, `PYRAMID` (regular polygon base, apex or frustum), `CYLINDER`, `CONE` (apex or
  truncated), `SPHERE`, `TORUS`. Each takes a right-handed orthonormal placement frame plus exact
  dimensions; the frame origin is the centre of the base, except for sphere and torus where it is
  the centre of the solid.

  The frame type throughout is `ucs::Ucs` (REQ-311) — for a surface, for an arc edge, and for
  placement. No second plane or frame type is introduced.

  Coordinates in the kernel are `double` and frame-agnostic: the kernel never learns about the
  document origin, and the narrowing to `float` local storage happens above it, once, at local
  magnitude (REQ-101, architecture §11.8).

  **Nothing is repaired silently.** Every construction and every validity failure returns a named
  reason with user-facing text (REQ-201). This is ADR-045.
- Acceptance:
  - The kernel builds and its entire test suite runs with **no graphics context** — no GL, no
    window, no ImGui, no document. The test target links the kernel translation unit directly.
  - `BOX`, `WEDGE`, `PYRAMID`, `CYLINDER`, `CONE`, `SPHERE` and `TORUS` each produce a solid that
    passes validation: indices in range, every loop a closed ring, **every edge used exactly twice
    and once in each direction** (manifold and orientable), no degenerate edge or face, finite
    coordinates, and a positive enclosed volume so the faces point outward.
  - Each primitive's vertex, edge and face counts and its Euler characteristic are the expected
    ones — including **0, not 2, for the torus**, since a genus-1 solid reporting 2 would mean the
    topology had quietly closed its hole.
  - Each primitive reports the **closed-form** volume and surface area, asserted against the
    textbook expression rather than against a previously recorded output, to a relative 1e-12 —
    far inside REQ-101's ±0.01, and tight enough that no formula error can hide.
  - Volume and surface area are **invariant under placement and rotation**: the same figures on the
    world frame, on a translated frame, and on a frame tilted off every axis.
  - A 10 ft solid modelled at state-plane magnitude (easting 3.5e6, northing 12.4e6) reports its
    volume and area to within 1e-6, including on a tilted frame and for the torus, whose integrals
    carry the most cancellation. This is #120's *"large survey coordinates"* requirement, and it is
    met by integrating every face about a reference point on the solid rather than about the world
    origin.
  - An invalid solid is **refused with a specific, printable reason**, never stored (REQ-201): a
    non-positive length, width, height or radius; a negative or too-large cone/pyramid top radius; a
    torus whose tube radius is not below its major radius (the one way a primitive here can
    self-intersect, so it is refused at construction); a pyramid side count outside 3..64; a
    non-finite dimension; and a placement frame that is skewed or left-handed.
  - Validation catches a **deliberately broken** solid: a missing face, a face boundary that does not
    close, two faces agreeing on an edge's direction, every face turned inward, a non-finite
    coordinate, and a solid with no shell. Mass properties refuse an invalid solid rather than
    reporting a plausible number.
  - Validation also catches **geometric** non-closure that the topology cannot see: a curved face
    whose parametric span disagrees with its own boundary loop is topologically flawless and
    geometrically a hole, and is rejected.
  - Tessellation is a derived representation: it never mutates the solid, a finer chord tolerance
    produces more triangles and a closer volume, every triangle's winding agrees with its stored
    analytic normal, and the volume and area re-derived from the triangles alone agree with the
    analytic figures. Tessellation refuses a non-positive tolerance and refuses an invalid solid.
  - Reported bounds contain the whole tessellation. They are permitted to be conservative and are
    never permitted to be tight — the same trade REQ-312 made for a tilted circle, since bounds that
    are too small clip geometry out of zoom extents and selection.
- Scope boundaries, stated rather than left silent:
  - **Self-intersection is not tested after the fact.** For the seven primitives it can only arise
    from a parameter, and each such parameter is refused by name. A general surface-surface
    intersection test belongs with the Phase 4 booleans, the first operation that can produce one.
  - **Centroid, moments of inertia and principal axes are not computed.** #120 places them in Phase
    6, and this requirement's acceptance names volume and surface area only.
  - **Plane faces are triangulated as a centroid fan**, correct for the convex, hole-free faces every
    primitive produces and refused by name for anything else. General polygon triangulation is Phase
    4's problem, when a boolean first produces a face that needs one.
  - **The document-facing half was a separate increment, and is now delivered** (ADR-045 addendum).
    The split was deliberate and is recorded because it shaped the work: increment 1 changed no
    existing source file, so it could not regress anything, and a create-command on `beta` before
    persistence existed would have let a user build a solid and lose it on save — the silent failure
    REQ-201 forbids. What increment 2 added: the `CadSolid` store on the document, the undo snapshot
    and `AppCommandState`; seven typed commands plus `SOLIDLIST`; `.gs` persistence of the topology;
    rendering in all three REQ-064 styles; the tessellation cache and a `BENCH SOLID` profile;
    Endpoint / Midpoint / Edge / Face snapping; selection, erase and the transform refusals; and the
    DXF/DWG exclusion message of ADR-045 (i).
- Acceptance, increment 2:
  - Each of the seven primitives is created by **one typed line** — a base point in the active UCS
    then exact dimensions — and reports its volume and surface area on creation. The UCS supplies
    the orientation, so a cylinder or cone gets an arbitrary 3D axis with no new command and no axis
    argument.
  - **A bare verb opens a prompted form** (amended 2026-09-01, D-2026-09-01-e). `CYLINDER` asks for
    the base centre point — clicked in the viewport or typed as `X,Y` / `X,Y,Z` — and then for its
    named dimensions by letter: `R` radius, `H` height, `L` length, `W` width, `T` top or tube
    radius, `S` sides. `R 4`, `R` followed by `4` on the next line, and a bare `4` filling the next
    unset dimension are all accepted; a dimension may be re-typed to correct it; **Enter creates**
    and Esc cancels by name. Enter with a required dimension still unset **names what is missing**
    and creates nothing, and a dimension the kernel refuses leaves the command open rather than
    discarding the base point and the values already given.
  - **Dimensions are PICKED with a live preview** (amended 2026-09-01, D-2026-09-01-f). Every
    dimension with a natural mouse gesture is chosen with the cursor while the candidate solid is
    drawn: a radius is a distance in the work plane, a height is the closest approach between the
    cursor ray and the solid's axis, and a box's or wedge's opposite corner sets length **and** width
    at once from a first corner. Before the whole solid is determined the preview shows the **base** —
    a circle, a rectangle, or a pyramid's polygon turning with the cursor. `D` takes a diameter at any
    radius prompt; `I` toggles the pyramid between inscribed and circumscribed. **Circumscribed is the
    default** — a pyramid's base radius is read as the polygon's apothem, AutoCAD's own default — and
    **both authoring forms apply that one reading**, so `PYRAMID x,y 4 6 0 15` and the prompted
    pyramid with base radius 6 build the identical solid. A pyramid defaults to
    four sides and a cone to an apex, so a keyword-and-default dimension never blocks the sequence.
    A **picked** dimension that completes the set creates the solid; a **typed** one waits for Enter.
    A height cannot be picked in plan view — the cursor lies on the work plane, so there is no offset
    along the axis to read — and the command says so rather than inventing a number.
  - **The preview and the commit come from one builder**, and the cursor is resolved once, in the
    command layer rather than the viewport. Asserted: the rubber the viewport would draw occupies the
    same space as the solid the click then builds.
  - **Both forms read one parameter table and reach one commit**, so the same numbers through either
    route produce the identical solid — asserted, not assumed. The one place this cost the one-line
    form a change: a pyramid's base and top radius are now read as the apothem (circumscribed) there
    too, matching the prompted default — the argument order and count of `PYRAMID x,y S R T H` are
    unchanged, but `R` and `T` mean what they mean at the prompt. This supersedes the original bullet's
    "there is no interactive pick-and-drag placement … the usage text says so rather than opening a
    prompt that never comes": a bare verb now opens the prompt. **Rubber-band drag preview, 3D grips
    and transforming a placed solid remain out of scope** — those need a 3D draft ghost and are
    #120's Phase 5 work, which is what that boundary was actually protecting.
  - Every bad input is **refused by name and creates nothing** (REQ-201): a non-positive dimension, a
    cone or pyramid top radius at or above the base, a torus whose tube radius **exactly equals** its
    ring radius (ADR-045 (f) as amended — a larger tube builds and self-intersects), a side count
    outside 3..64, a **fractional** side count (refused, never truncated to a
    square), a non-numeric value, too few or too many values, and too many coordinate components.
  - Solids draw in **every** REQ-064 visual style, and each style means something: 2D Wireframe draws
    the edges; **Hidden writes the faces to the depth buffer with colour writes off** so near
    geometry genuinely occludes far; Shaded lights the faces and draws the edges over them.
  - **A curved solid's wireframe carries isolines** (amended 2026-09-01, D-2026-09-01-g). The
    topological edges alone are a poor picture of a curved solid — a sphere's are two meridians, which
    draw as a lens rather than a ball — so curves are drawn *across* each curved face, from the same
    analytic surface evaluator the shaded triangles use. The count is per **full turn**, as AutoCAD's
    `ISOLINES` is; it is set by an `ISOLINES` command in the report-or-set shape, defaults to **4**,
    accepts **0** (meaning edges only), refuses a value outside 0..256 by name while leaving the
    setting standing, and is saved in `.gs` and in the user preferences, clamped on read. The
    directions are per surface kind: a cylinder and a cone get rulings along the axis only, a sphere
    gets meridians and latitude circles, a torus gets tube and ring circles, and a plane gets none —
    a ring part way up a cylinder is not something AutoCAD draws, and reads as an edge that is not
    there. No isoline falls on a **seam**, where an edge is already drawn, and changing the count
    changes the wireframe and **nothing else** — the shaded triangles are asserted unchanged.
  - The tessellation is **cached** on `(solid, chord tolerance, isoline count)` and regenerated on
    nothing else, so it is not rebuilt per frame (#120). `BENCH SOLID` measures profile (d) of
    REQ-100; the instrument is delivered and the number is not yet taken — see REQ-100's status.
  - **Solid topology survives `.gs` save and reopen**, to a relative 1e-6 on volume and area and
    exactly on the vertex/edge/face counts. What is written is the topology and not the recipe, so a
    shape with no recipe will save the same way. A drawing with no solids omits the key entirely and
    serializes byte-identically to a pre-REQ-313 build. A malformed or invalid stored solid is
    refused with the kernel's own reason and not loaded.
  - **Face and edge snapping return accurate XYZ.** A face snap is projected onto the face's analytic
    surface, so on a cylinder the point is on the cylinder rather than a sagitta short of it on the
    tessellator's chord. An edge snap is clamped to the edge's own extent. A solid's vertices answer
    Endpoint and its edge middles answer Midpoint.
  - A solid is **selectable** by click (against its edges — what is drawn in every style) and by
    window/crossing box (against its analytic bounds, because a sphere's two stored vertices describe
    almost none of it), is **erasable in one undo step**, and is invisible AND unclickable on an off
    or frozen layer. Every transform command **refuses** it with a stated reason rather than silently
    leaving it behind.
  - DXF and DWG export **name and count** the solids they skipped, in both writers.
- Owner-layer: Domain (`src/util/brep.{hpp,cpp}`, `src/util/cadsolid.hpp`); Commands, IO, Renderer
  and Viewport for increment 2
- Status: accepted (2026-09-01) — see D-2026-09-01-b and ADR-045.
- Revisions: 2026-09-01 — proposed and accepted (D-2026-09-01-b, TASK-166); increment 2 delivered the
  same day (TASK-167, ADR-045 addendum). **Amended the same day (D-2026-09-01-e, TASK-170): a bare
  verb now opens a prompted form** — base point then named dimensions by letter — at the user's
  request; the one-line form is unchanged. The original "no interactive placement" boundary was about
  rubber-band drag preview, which stays out of scope. Phase 3 of GitHub #120,
  filed as #146. Representation, DXF/DWG export and the two-increment split each confirmed with the
  user before any code was written.

### REQ-314 — Feature operations on the solid kernel: extrude, revolve, slice, and analytic Booleans (GitHub issue #147)
- Purpose: REQ-313 gave GoSurvey a B-rep kernel and seven primitive solids, but a kernel that can
  only make boxes and cylinders is not yet useful for design. Issue #147 (Phase 4 of #120) is the
  phase that makes it useful: turn a drawn profile into a solid, and combine solids. Issue #147 also
  states the project's own constraint on the hardest part — *"Booleans are the highest-risk item in
  all of #120... where solid modellers classically fail on degenerate input"* — and REQ-201's
  principle governs it directly: an operation that cannot produce a valid solid must fail safely and
  leave the model unchanged, never store a corrupt one.
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Depends on: REQ-313 / ADR-045 (the kernel and its validity invariants), REQ-311 (`ucs::Ucs` as the
  one frame type), REQ-312 (arbitrary-plane curves as profile sources).
- Constraints in force: REQ-101 (±0.01 ft), REQ-201 (no silent failure), REQ-300 (dependency
  discipline — an in-tree kernel, no ACIS/OpenCascade), REQ-301 (minimal abstraction), REQ-100
  profile (d) (the solid frame budget).

- Statement: The `util/` B-rep kernel (`src/util/brep.{hpp,cpp}`) gains **feature operations** that
  consume the Phase 2 `ucs::Ucs` and the kernel's own curve types and produce Phase 3 B-rep solids.
  Every operation is pure geometry — no GL, no ImGui, no document, no `AppCommandState` — and every
  one returns a named, printable reason on failure (REQ-201, ADR-045). The result of a feature
  operation is a `Solid` exactly as REQ-313 defines it: real topology (solid → shells → faces →
  loops → edges → vertices), every face an analytic surface, every edge an analytic curve, volume
  and area integrated in closed form, triangles derived on demand and never stored.

  **A feature-operation result may carry no recipe.** REQ-313 already established that a recipe is
  optional and that the topology, not the recipe, is the stored truth — it named "the Phase 4
  boolean result" as the case that proves it. That case is now real: a Boolean and a slice store
  topology only. Extrude and revolve **may** record an operation recipe (source-profile reference
  plus parameters) for future parametric regeneration, but validity, mass properties and
  tessellation read the topology alone, exactly as for a primitive, and a re-opened `.gs` solid
  whose recipe cannot be resolved still loads from its stored topology.

  **Profile → solid**
  - **Extrude** — a single closed, planar, non-self-intersecting profile loop of line and arc
    segments (a closed `Polyline` per REQ-053, a `Circle`, or an arbitrary-plane circle/closed arc
    chain per REQ-312) is swept along a direction for a distance. A straight extrusion of a line
    segment produces a plane face; of a circular arc, a cylinder face; of a full circle, a closed
    cylinder capped by two planar disks. **Optional taper** offsets the profile as it sweeps, which
    keeps line segments on planes and turns arc segments into cone faces. The cap faces close the
    solid at both ends. An arc may curve **into** the loop as readily as out of it (amended
    2026-09-03, D-2026-09-03-e): the concave wall it sweeps is a cylinder face whose material is on
    the far side from its own axis, which is exactly what `Surface::inward` records — so a bay bitten
    out of a rectangle, and the inner wall of an annular sector, both build.
  - **Revolve** — the same profile revolved about an axis (any line in 3D, including a profile edge)
    through a full or partial angle. A line segment parallel to the axis sweeps a cylinder; a line
    segment skew to the axis sweeps a cone; a line segment meeting the axis sweeps a plane (a disk
    sector) or a cone; a circular arc sweeps a portion of a sphere (arc centre on the axis) or a
    torus (arc centre off the axis, in the axis plane). A partial revolve adds two planar cap faces
    on the start and end angle; a full revolve closes on itself with none.

  Extrude and revolve are the two feature operations whose every output face falls inside REQ-313's
  five analytic surface kinds and whose every output edge is a line or an arc. **Sweep along an
  arbitrary 3D path and loft between profiles are NOT in this requirement** — a general swept or
  lofted surface is a freeform (spline) surface the original kernel could not represent, and adding one
  was a separate architectural decision. They are tracked as REQ-315 (unblocked 2026-09-03 by
  ADR-048 — a minimal in-tree NURBS surface).

  **Slice**
  Cut a solid by an unbounded plane (a `ucs::Ucs`, or three points, or a planar face of the solid),
  keeping one side or both. Each kept piece is a valid closed solid: the cut introduces one new
  planar face per piece, bounded by the intersection of the plane with the solid's faces. A slice
  that misses the solid entirely, or that meets it only tangentially, is **reported and changes
  nothing** rather than producing a zero-volume sliver.

  **Booleans — `UNION`, `SUBTRACT`, `INTERSECT`**
  Two solids are combined by a boundary-representation Boolean: the faces of each operand are split
  along their intersection curves with the other operand, the pieces are classified inside / outside
  / on-boundary, and the kept pieces are stitched into a new closed manifold solid. The result is
  analytic — a face that came through an operation unmodified keeps its original analytic surface;
  a face split by the operation keeps that same surface with a new boundary loop. **New edges created
  where two analytic surfaces cross carry an analytic intersection curve.** Where that intersection
  is a line or an arc (plane ∩ plane, plane ∩ cylinder parallel to the axis, coaxial cylinder ∩
  cylinder, sphere ∩ plane, and the other conic-section-free cases) the kernel's existing
  `CurveKind` covers it. Where it is not (a plane cutting a cylinder obliquely gives an ellipse; two
  non-coaxial cylinders give a quartic curve) the kernel needs a **general intersection-curve
  representation** — see ADR-046 and the increment plan; the first Boolean increment is scoped to
  the cases the current `CurveKind` already covers, and an operand pair that would produce a curve
  outside that set is **refused by name**, never approximated.

  **Boolean robustness is a first-class requirement, not an edge case.** Issue #147 names the
  hazards and each has a defined outcome:
  - **Coincident and near-coincident faces** — detected within a stated tolerance and handled as a
    shared boundary, not double-counted; the tolerance is `ucs`/`brep` epsilon at local magnitude,
    the same scale REQ-101 works at.
  - **Tangent surfaces** — where two surfaces touch without crossing, no spurious edge is created.
  - **Shared edges and vertices** — reused, not duplicated; the result still satisfies "every edge
    used exactly twice, once in each direction."
  - **A result that is empty** (e.g. `INTERSECT` of two disjoint solids) or **disjoint** (more than
    one shell) is **reported as such** — an empty result stores nothing, a disjoint result is either
    stored as a multi-shell solid if valid or refused, per ADR-046 — never stored as a degenerate
    single solid.
  - **A Boolean that cannot produce a solid passing `brep::Validate` leaves both operands exactly as
    they were** (REQ-201). The operands are not consumed until the result is validated and committed.

- Acceptance:
  - **The feature operations build and are unit-tested with no graphics context** — the kernel
    translation unit is linked directly into the test target, exactly as REQ-313's acceptance
    requires, and no test needs a window, GL, ImGui, or a document.
  - **Extrude** of a rectangle, a circle, and a closed line+arc polyline each produces a solid that
    passes `brep::Validate` (manifold, orientable, positive volume, finite coordinates), with the
    expected vertex/edge/face counts and Euler characteristic. A tapered extrude of the same
    profiles likewise validates and its side faces are cones where the profile had arcs.
  - **Revolve** of a line and of an arc, full and partial, about an axis in the profile plane each
    produces a valid closed solid. A line parallel to the axis revolved a full turn reproduces the
    REQ-313 cylinder to a relative 1e-9 on volume and area; an arc centred on the axis revolved a
    full turn reproduces the REQ-313 sphere to the same tolerance. These two assertions tie the
    feature path to the primitive path so a formula error in either cannot hide.
  - **Volume and surface area of every feature result are closed-form**, asserted against the
    textbook expression for the cases that have one (a revolved rectangle is a cylinder or a washer;
    a revolved right triangle is a cone) to a relative 1e-9, and against Pappus's theorem for the
    general revolve, all far inside REQ-101's ±0.01.
  - **Union, subtract and intersect** of two overlapping boxes, a box and a coaxial cylinder, and
    two coaxial cylinders each produce a solid whose volume matches the hand-computed value to
    within REQ-101, and which passes `brep::Validate`. *(Refined 2026-09-02, D-2026-09-02-b: the two
    curved-operand cases are met for UNION and INTERSECT in increment B1; their SUBTRACT — a round
    hole, whose wall faces inward — is met in increment B2, which adds inward-facing curved faces.
    B1 refuses curved SUBTRACT by name.)*
  - **The degenerate Boolean cases each have the outcome stated above**, each covered by a test: two
    boxes sharing a full face; a box and a cylinder tangent along a line; two solids sharing one
    edge; `INTERSECT` of two disjoint solids (empty, reported); `SUBTRACT` that would split the
    result in two (disjoint, per ADR-046). None of these stores a solid that fails validation.
  - **A failed Boolean leaves both operands bit-identical** — asserted by comparing the operand
    topology and every coordinate before and after a deliberately unsatisfiable operation.
  - **An operand pair that would produce an intersection curve outside the kernel's `CurveKind` set**
    is **refused with a specific reason** naming the surface pair, and stores nothing. *(Refined
    2026-09-02, D-2026-09-02-h: an obliquely-oriented cylinder meets a plane along an ellipse —
    `CurveKind::Ellipse`, added in increment B2b-1 — so SLICE and the Booleans handle it from B2b-1
    on; two non-coaxial cylinders (a quartic curve) keep the refusal until B2b-2. Steinmetz coda,
    D-2026-09-02-i: two **equal-radius** cylinders whose axes cross at right angles meet along two
    ellipses, not a quartic — INTERSECT (the bicylinder), SUBTRACT (`A − B`, a clean perpendicular
    channel) and UNION (a T-pipe) of that pair all build in closed form from B2b-1 on. Every other
    non-coaxial cylinder pair keeps the refusal until B2b-2.)*
  - **Slice** of a box and of a cylinder by a plane, keeping one side and keeping both, produces
    valid closed solids whose volumes sum to the original within REQ-101. A slice that misses the
    solid reports it and changes nothing. *(An **oblique** cut through a cylinder produces an
    elliptical cut face — `CurveKind::Ellipse`, increment B2b-1, D-2026-09-02-h; a perpendicular cut
    stays the circular case from increment 3.)*
  - **Every operation is one undoable step** — a single `AppCommandState` undo snapshot restores the
    pre-operation document exactly, including when the operation consumed its operands.
  - **Results survive `.gs` save and reopen** with topology intact — vertex/edge/face counts exactly,
    volume and area to a relative 1e-6 — using REQ-313's existing solid serialization, since a
    recipe-less feature result is stored the same way a recipe-less primitive already is. A drawing
    with no feature-operation solids serializes byte-identically to a pre-REQ-314 build, and
    `kGsFormatVersion` is not bumped unless the operation recipe is actually persisted (a decision
    deferred to the increment that first adds it).
  - **Operations are numerically stable at survey coordinate magnitudes** — a 10 ft feature result
    modelled at state-plane magnitude (easting 3.5e6, northing 12.4e6), including on a tilted frame,
    reports its volume and area to within 1e-6, integrating about a reference point on the solid
    rather than the world origin, exactly as REQ-313 does.
  - **REQ-100 profile (d) still holds** — feature-operation solids tessellate through the same cached
    path as primitives and add no per-frame cost; `BENCH SOLID` is unaffected.
  - DXF and DWG export **name and count** feature-operation solids among the solids they skip, with
    no new export behaviour — the ADR-045 (i) exclusion already covers every `CadSolid`.

- Scope boundaries, stated rather than left silent:
  - **Sweep and loft are not here.** They need a freeform surface type in the kernel. Tracked as
    REQ-315 — unblocked 2026-09-03 by ADR-048 (a minimal in-tree NURBS surface); delivered there,
    loft first.
  - **General analytic Boolean intersection curves (ellipse, quartic) are phased.** The first Boolean
    increment covers only operand pairs whose intersection stays within `{Line, Arc}`; the rest is a
    later increment that first adds a general intersection-curve representation. This is not a
    permanent limitation — it is a delivery order chosen so a working, verifiable Boolean ships
    before the hardest geometry is attempted.
  - **Profiles are a single closed loop.** Multi-loop profiles (an extruded shape with a hole) are
    deferred to a later increment; a profile with more than one loop is refused by name.
  - **Interactive placement, 3D grips, and dragging a feature result are #120 Phase 5**, unchanged
    from REQ-313's boundary. The Phase 4 commands take typed / picked profiles and parameters and a
    command-line or prompted form, matching the primitive commands.
  - **Fillet and chamfer on a solid edge are #120 Phase 5**, and sectioning / centroid / moments are
    Phase 6 — none are in this requirement.
- Owner-layer: Domain (`src/util/brep.{hpp,cpp}`); Commands, IO, Renderer and Viewport for the
  document-facing increments.
- Status: **accepted (2026-09-02)** — see D-2026-09-02-a and ADR-046. Implemented in the increments
  ADR-046 lists, each its own task and PR; extrude first.
- Revisions: 2026-09-02 — proposed and accepted as written (D-2026-09-02-a, TASK-173). Phase 4 of GitHub #120, filed as
  #147. The Boolean method (analytic B-rep rather than mesh-based) and the spec-first / sliced
  delivery were confirmed with the user before this text was written; sweep and loft were split out
  to REQ-315 because the current kernel has no freeform surface type.
  2026-09-02 — D-2026-09-02-b (TASK-178): curved-operand Booleans in increment B1 are limited to
  UNION and INTERSECT; a curved SUBTRACT needs an inward-facing curved face that ADR-045's `Surface`
  cannot express, so it moves to B2. Acceptance list annotated accordingly; no requirement removed.
  2026-09-02 — D-2026-09-02-h (TASK-185): B2b is split into B2b-1 (`CurveKind::Ellipse`, oblique
  plane ∩ cylinder — SLICE then Boolean; bumps `kGsFormatVersion`) and B2b-2 (procedural
  `CurveKind::Intersection` — quartic etc.). ADR-045 (d) amended: `CurveKind` is `{Line, Arc, Ellipse}`.
  2026-09-02 — D-2026-09-02-i (TASK-186): B2b-1 gains a Steinmetz coda (perpendicular equal-radius
  cylinders meet along two ellipses — closed-form). ADR-045 (b) amended: a face bounded by a B2b-2
  procedural intersection curve is integrated by adaptive numerical quadrature (inside REQ-101);
  every analytic face keeps closed form.
  2026-09-02 — D-2026-09-02-c (TASK-184): increment B2 is split into B2a (adds `Surface::inward`,
  lifts curved SUBTRACT for the pairs B1 already recognises — round hole, blind pocket, spherical
  dimple, counterbore) and B2b (general analytic intersection curve — ellipse / quartic). The
  curved-SUBTRACT acceptance lines deferred by D-2026-09-02-b are met in B2a. ADR-045 (d) amended.

### REQ-315 — Sweep and loft on the solid kernel (GitHub issue #147, split from REQ-314)
- Purpose: issue #147's acceptance names sweep and loft alongside extrude and revolve. A general
  swept or lofted surface is a freeform surface that REQ-313's original kernel — five analytic
  surface kinds — cannot represent, so REQ-315 was split from REQ-314 and parked. ADR-048
  (D-2026-09-03-b) resolves that: the kernel gains a minimal-subset NURBS surface. This requirement
  is now unblocked and its Statement is written.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Depends on: REQ-314 (the feature-operation layer and its robustness / persistence conditions);
  ADR-048 (the `SurfaceKind::Nurbs` freeform surface and its numerical mass properties); REQ-313 /
  ADR-045 (the kernel and its validity invariants); REQ-311 (`ucs::Ucs`); REQ-312 (arbitrary-plane
  curves).
- Constraints in force: REQ-101 (±0.01 ft), REQ-201 (no silent failure), REQ-300 (in-tree kernel,
  no third-party geometry library), REQ-301 (minimal abstraction), REQ-100 profile (d).
- Statement:
  - **The kernel gains one freeform surface kind, `SurfaceKind::Nurbs`** — a rational tensor-product
    B-spline patch, degree ≤ 3 per direction, untrimmed, split at seams into faces that each bound
    normally (ADR-045 (d)). It is evaluated, differentiated and tessellated by hand-written in-tree
    code; its volume and surface area are computed by adaptive numerical quadrature to a tolerance
    far inside REQ-101's ±0.01 ft (ADR-045 (b) as widened by D-2026-09-03-b). It serializes to `.gs`
    as additive keys and bumps `kGsFormatVersion` to 4. A malformed patch is refused on load by name.
  - **LOFT** builds a closed solid skinned between **two or more planar profiles**. Each profile is a
    closed loop of line / arc / ellipse edges; the profiles are matched edge-for-edge in order and
    must have the **same edge count** (a divided-profile or point-capped loft is out of scope). Each
    corresponding pair of profile edges spans one patch — ruled where the span is straight, rational
    where a profile edge is an arc — and the two end profiles cap the solid as planar faces.
  - **SWEEP** runs **one closed planar profile** along a 3D **path** that is a line, an arc, or a
    bulge polyline. The profile's orientation along the path is carried by a **rotation-minimizing
    frame**, with an **optional constant twist angle** and an option to hold the profile normal to
    the path or hold it at a fixed world orientation. A straight path reproduces REQ-314 extrude and
    a planar circular-arc path reproduces revolve — asserted to agree where the analytic result
    exists; every other path produces NURBS side faces.
  - **A path that closes back on its own start point — a single full-circle arc segment, or a
    multi-segment bulge-polyline path whose last point coincides with its first** — is a **closed
    sweep path**, not a refusal. Its volume matches the Pappus value for a full turn about the path's
    axis, the same relationship a partial arc-path sweep already has; a non-circular closed path (an
    ellipse-like or multi-arc loop) is built by the same rule. A closed path builds **no end caps** — the first and last cross-section
    rings are the same ring, wrapped together (mirroring `brep::Revolve`'s existing full-turn
    treatment: no literal 2π edge, no duplicate vertices at the seam) — rather than two coincident or
    degenerate planar faces. **Fixed orientation on a closed path is attempted, not specially
    refused, but never succeeds**: a rigid, non-rotating cross-section translated all the way around
    any closed loop back to itself encloses no net volume (confirmed against independent non-planar
    examples, not assumed), so it is refused by the kernel's existing generic closure check
    (`Problem::NotClosed`, REQ-201) — the same check any degenerate closed surface fails, not a
    sweep-specific rule. A **nonzero twist** on a closed path stays refused
    (`Problem::SweepUnsupportedOption`) — not as an increment boundary but because it is geometrically
    inconsistent: the seam ring is one ring, and a linear twist from 0 at the start to a nonzero angle
    at the end would need it to carry two different
    orientations at once. A rotation-minimizing frame with zero twist closes consistently around a
    planar closed path by construction.
  - **A sharp (tangent-discontinuous) corner where BOTH adjoining path segments are straight, and the
    profile is polygonal (no arc edge), is mitred** rather than refused (REQ-315 2026-09-04, issue
    #259): the shared ring at the corner lies on the plane that bisects the incoming and outgoing
    tangent directions, one straight cut through both legs' cross-sections, matching what a real
    mitred pipe or duct joint does — no gap, no overlap, and each leg's own swept volume is
    unaffected (`area × leg length`, exactly as an unmitred straight run, because the bisector plane
    passes through the path's own corner point). A sharp corner touching an **arc** path segment
    stays refused (`Problem::SweepPathCorner`): mitring it would need a trimmed NURBS patch (the
    cross-section reaches the cut plane at a different point per profile vertex around the curve),
    which REQ-315 already marks out of scope as its own future decision — this is not a smaller
    version of that decision, it is the same one, deferred for the same reason. A sharp corner with a
    profile that has an arc edge stays refused too (`Problem::SweepMitreProfileArc`): shearing a
    circular profile edge onto an oblique plane makes an ellipse, a curve this increment does not
    build. A corner too sharp to mitre — the two directions fold back near a full reversal, so the
    bisector plane is degenerate — is refused by name (`Problem::SweepMitreCollapsed`), the same
    "refuse rather than build a collapsed shape" rule REQ-317's polysolid mitre already applies.
  - **Twist works on a straight (or multi-segment all-straight) path**, not only a single segment
    (REQ-315 2026-09-04, issue #259), and **fixed orientation works on any path, including a curved
    one**. **Twist accumulates proportionally to distance travelled** — a straight segment's share is
    its chord length — so a short segment turns the profile less than a long one, matching the
    standard convention (and unchanged for the single-segment case, where this reduces to the existing
    "0 at the start, the full angle at the end" rule exactly). Twist is refused, by name, combined with
    an **arc** path segment (`Problem::SweepTwistNeedsStraightPath`): within an arc band a profile
    vertex's true trajectory under a continuously varying twist compounds the path's own rotation with
    the twist's, which the arc band's construction (a plain circular arc, or an exact rational revolve)
    cannot represent — the same category of gap as a mitred corner touching an arc segment, and
    deferred for the same reason rather than built silently wrong. **Fixed orientation** carries the
    profile's original world axes unrotated through every segment, straight or arc — mechanically the
    same "translate only" placement already used for a single straight segment; through an arc segment
    this is still exact, because a rigid body under pure translation moves every point by the identical
    vector regardless of the path's own shape, so the arc band's construction becomes the same ruled
    (straight-rail) surface the straight-segment case already uses. Twist and fixed orientation compose
    on a straight path: a fixed-orientation profile can still be given a twist, spinning about its own
    unchanging normal as it travels. A sharp corner is still classified and, where eligible, still
    named a mitred joint under fixed orientation — but the mitre **shear itself does not run** there:
    fixed orientation already places every ring exactly on its path point (never rotated, so no
    reconciling cut is needed the way the aligned case needs one), and shearing it anyway would move
    it off that point for no reason. A real defect of exactly this shape — the shear gated on "is this
    corner mitred" but not on `alignToPath` — was found and fixed during this task's own final review.
  - **Fixed orientation on a curved path is not checked for the swept envelope folding over itself.**
    There is no rotation-minimizing frame to prevent it, unlike the aligned case, but `brep::
    SelfIntersects` is a narrow, torus-specific check (ADR-045 (f)'s tube-larger-than-ring case), not a
    general overlap detector, and building a real one (checking every face against every other) is a
    separate undertaking, decided against for this task. A profile too large, or a path too tightly
    curved, for this option can therefore build a solid that occupies the same space twice — a known,
    documented limitation rather than a checked-and-refused case.
  - Both commands exist in the **typed** and the **prompted** shape the REQ-313 / REQ-314 commands
    use, pick their operands in the viewport or by entity id, preview the result, and commit as
    **one undoable step**. The source profiles and path are consumed only after the result passes
    `brep::Validate`; a failure is refused by name and the document is untouched (REQ-314 / ADR-046
    (d), unchanged). `brep::SelfIntersects` is checked by other REQ-313/314 kernel builders where it
    is meaningful (ADR-045 (f)'s torus case); sweep's own fixed-orientation gap, above, is the one
    place in this requirement that is not covered by it.
  - The result stores **topology only** by default; it may optionally record a recipe (profile / path
    entity ids and parameters) that is never consulted by validity, mass properties or tessellation
    (ADR-045 (c), ADR-046 (e)).
- Acceptance:
  - **Loft and sweep each produce a valid closed solid** from planar profiles — `brep::Validate`
    passes (manifold, oriented, geometrically closed per ADR-045 (e)) and `brep::SelfIntersects` is
    false — or the operation is **refused by name** and nothing is stored (REQ-201). Mismatched
    profile edge counts, a non-planar profile, a self-crossing profile, a degenerate path, and a
    zero-length span are each refused by name.
  - **Volumes are within REQ-101 (±0.01 ft, or the documented relative tolerance for large
    magnitudes) of hand-computed values** for a set of shapes with known answers: a lofted prism
    (two identical profiles) equals the extrude of that profile; a lofted frustum equals the cone /
    pyramid frustum formula; a lofted circular barrel and a swept elbow are checked against a fine
    independent numerical reference. The quadrature converges and its result does not move when the
    display tessellation quality changes.
  - **A straight-path sweep equals REQ-314 extrude** and a **planar arc-path sweep of an in-plane
    profile equals revolve**, to REQ-101, asserted in tests.
  - **A closed sweep path (a full-circle arc segment, or a multi-segment path returning to its start)
    builds a valid closed solid with no end-cap faces** — `brep::Validate` passes and the ring at the
    path's start is shared with the ring at its end rather than duplicated. Its volume matches the
    Pappus value for a full turn, to REQ-101, the same check the existing partial-arc-path case
    already uses (`brep::Revolve` itself cannot be cross-checked here: it requires the profile to
    *touch* its axis, the opposite of what a curved-path sweep already requires of an arc segment's
    axis — a closed-path sweep therefore builds a shape, a hollow ring, that Revolve alone cannot). A
    degenerate closed path (zero enclosed length, a path that only touches its start without properly
    closing) is refused by name, not silently accepted as closed.
  - **A mitred straight-to-straight corner's total volume equals the sum of each leg's
    `area × length`**, to REQ-101, asserted in tests — the closed-form identity that makes a mitred
    corner testable without a separate numerical reference: a plane through the path's own vertex
    truncates a constant-cross-section prism at exactly its nominal length on each side, regardless
    of the plane's tilt. A corner touching an arc path segment, or a corner whose profile has an arc
    edge, is refused by name, not silently built as an unmitred (gapped or overlapping) joint. A
    corner too sharp to mitre (near a full reversal) is refused by name, not built as a
    self-intersecting or inverted band.
  - **Twist works on a straight (or multi-segment all-straight) path and composes with fixed
    orientation there**; twist accumulates proportionally to distance travelled, checked against a
    path whose segments have different lengths and cross-checked ring-for-ring against an independent
    single-segment reference sweep, asserted in tests. Twist is **not** asserted to preserve volume:
    each band's surface is a ruled (straight-line) interpolation between its two differently-twisted
    end rings, not a true continuous rotation, so it does not generally preserve `area × length` the
    way an untwisted or uniformly-translated band does — this was checked directly (not assumed) while
    implementing, and the false assumption corrected before this bullet was written. **Fixed
    orientation works on any path including a curved one**, checked against a hand-derived reference
    (each ring is the first ring translated by the same vector the path's own two endpoints differ
    by — provable from "fixed orientation never rotates," not merely plausible) — including through a
    sharp (mitre-classified) corner, where a real defect (the mitre shear running regardless of
    `alignToPath`, moving a fixed-orientation ring off its true path point) was found and fixed by
    exactly this check, on an open path with two non-coplanar sharp corners. A nonzero twist on a
    closed path, or combined with an arc segment, is refused by name, not silently built wrong. A
    fixed-orientation sweep on a **closed** path is refused too, always, as having no enclosed volume
    (`Problem::NotClosed`, the kernel's own generic closure check — see the Statement note above), and
    a fixed-orientation sweep that folds over itself on an **open** curved path is **not** refused —
    no real detector exists to build that check on — asserted by its absence: no test claims that
    refusal exists.
  - **Results survive `.gs` save and reopen** with vertex / edge / face counts identical and volume
    and area within a relative 1e-6. A drawing with no NURBS face serializes byte-identically to a
    version-3 build. A version-4 file with a malformed patch is refused with the kernel's reason and
    not loaded.
  - **Every operation is a single undoable step**, and undo restores the exact prior document
    including the consumed profiles and path.
  - **Operations remain stable at survey-coordinate magnitudes** — a loft / sweep built with its
    frame origin at a state-plane coordinate reports the same volume and area (to REQ-101) as the
    same shape built near the origin; no integrand is a difference of two large nearly-equal numbers
    (ADR-045 (g)).
  - **Loft and sweep draw in every REQ-064 visual style**, with isolines on the NURBS faces from the
    same evaluator the shaded triangles use (REQ-313 isoline precedent), and are cached on
    `(solid, chord tolerance, isoline count)` like every other solid. REQ-100 profile (d) still holds
    on a scene containing loft / sweep solids.
  - **Face and edge snapping return accurate XYZ** on a NURBS face — a face snap is projected onto
    the patch, not the tessellator's chord.
  - **DXF / DWG export names and counts** the loft / sweep solids it skips, in both writers
    (ADR-045 (i), unchanged).
- Out of scope (each its own future decision): trimmed NURBS; a loft / sweep solid as a Boolean
  operand; multi-loop, divided, or point-capped profiles; NURBS curve edges; fillet / chamfer /
  section / moments of a freeform result (#120 Phases 5–6); interactive 3D placement and grips.
- Owner-layer: Domain (`src/util/brep.{hpp,cpp}`, optionally a new `src/util/nurbs.{hpp,cpp}`;

- Status: **accepted (2026-09-03)** — see D-2026-09-03-b and ADR-048. Delivered in two increments,
  each its own task and PR: **loft first**, then sweep.
- Revisions: 2026-09-02 — accepted as a parked scope holder, Statement blocked on the
  freeform-surface question (D-2026-09-02-a, TASK-173). 2026-09-03 — unblocked; Statement and
  Acceptance written and accepted; freeform surface decided as a minimal in-tree NURBS patch
  (D-2026-09-03-b, ADR-048, TASK-187). Loft-before-sweep order confirmed with the user.
  2026-09-03 — LOFT (PRs #244/#246/#247) and SWEEP (PRs #248–#251) delivered; SWEEP's `T` (twist)
  and `A` (path-alignment) keyword options wired to the kernel's existing `brep::SweepOptions`
  (TASK-194). Deferred, each its own later increment: a twist or fixed orientation on a curved or
  multi-segment path, a mitred path corner, a full-turn arc segment.
  2026-09-04 — closed sweep paths (a full-circle arc segment, and multi-segment paths that return to
  their start) accepted as a Statement/Acceptance addition (issue #259 follow-up to #241; scoped by
  user decision to include multi-segment closed loops, not just the single-arc case). Twist / fixed
  orientation and mitred corners remain deferred, unchanged.
  2026-09-04 — a straight-to-straight mitred corner accepted as a Statement/Acceptance addition
  (issue #259 follow-up to #241). Scoped by user decision, after a mid-investigation finding: a
  corner touching an arc path segment needs a trimmed NURBS patch to mitre correctly, and REQ-315
  already marks trimmed NURBS out of scope as its own future decision, so a full-generality mitre
  would have reopened that decision rather than merely extended this one. The user chose to ship the
  straight-to-straight case now and leave the arc-adjacent case deferred alongside it, rather than
  open the trimmed-NURBS question here. Twist / fixed orientation remains deferred, unchanged.
  2026-09-04 — twist (straight paths) and fixed orientation (any path) accepted as a
  Statement/Acceptance addition (issue #259 follow-up to #241, the last of its three items), narrower
  than first scoped after two mid-investigation findings put back to the user. First: twist combined
  with an arc segment produced a silently wrong volume — the arc band's construction (a plain circular
  arc, or an exact rational revolve) cannot represent a vertex's true trajectory under a continuously
  varying twist, the same category of gap as a mitred corner touching an arc segment — so the user
  chose to refuse twist+arc by name (`Problem::SweepTwistNeedsStraightPath`) rather than build it
  wrong; twist on a straight or multi-segment-straight path, and fixed orientation on any path
  including a curved one, ship as designed (twist distribution: proportional to distance travelled,
  the standard convention, over an alternative of an equal share per segment). Second: a planned
  internal `brep::SelfIntersects` check for fixed-orientation-on-a-curve turned out not to work —
  `SelfIntersects` is a narrow, torus-specific check (ADR-045 (f)), not a general overlap detector —
  so the user chose to build fixed orientation on a curve as designed and document the
  folds-over-itself risk as a known limitation rather than build a real detector (a separate
  undertaking) or refuse curved fixed-orientation sweeps outright. A nonzero twist on a closed path is
  refused as geometrically inconsistent (one seam ring cannot carry two different end-of-path
  orientations), not as a further increment boundary. An independent final review found one more real
  defect before this task was called done: the mitre shear ran for a fixed-orientation ring at a sharp
  corner even though fixed orientation needs no shear there at all (every ring already sits exactly on
  its path point without one) — fixed by gating the shear on `alignToPath` the same way the mitre
  frame-turn already was. That review also surfaced that fixed orientation on a **closed** path always
  encloses zero volume (a non-rotating cross-section translated around any closed loop returns to its
  exact start), refused by the kernel's ordinary closure check rather than needing a sweep-specific
  rule — confirmed against independent examples rather than assumed, and recorded above rather than
  left as a surprise. Issue #259 is now fully addressed, the third item narrower than the other two
  but for stated, verified reasons rather than left unstated.

### REQ-316 — Polylines have arc segments; POLYLINE draws them and JOIN builds them

- Purpose: a polyline today is a chain of straight segments. Real survey and civil linework —
  road centrelines, edge of pavement, cul-de-sacs, parcel boundaries with curved frontage — mixes
  straight runs and circular arcs in one connected object. Users need to draw that in one POLYLINE
  command by switching to an "arc mode", and to build it from existing separate lines and arcs with
  JOIN. DXF has carried this since the 1980s as the per-vertex **bulge** on an `LWPOLYLINE`; GoSurvey
  parses the bulge on import and immediately throws it away by breaking the arc into short straight
  chords, so a curved polyline cannot survive even a round-trip today.
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Depends on: ADR-047 (the per-vertex bulge storage decision).
- Statement: a polyline segment may be a circular arc, recorded as a per-vertex bulge
  (`tan(θ/4)`, 0 = straight) in a parallel `userPolylineVertsBulge` array beside the vertex store
  (ADR-047). The behaviour this enables:
  1. **POLYLINE arc mode.** While POLYLINE is drawing, the keyword `ARC` switches following segments
     to arc mode and `LINE` switches back. (Full words — `A` and `ANGLE` are the existing
     segment-bearing lock; D-2026-09-02-f.) In arc mode the default arc is tangent to the previous
     segment with its far end at the next picked or typed point; the sub-options `RADIUS` and
     `CANGLE` (included angle) set the next arc segment. `UNDO` removes the last segment whatever the
     mode, and continues from the previous vertex. `CEnter`, `Second point` and `Direction` are
     deferred past increment 1.
  2. **The stored entity is one polyline.** A single polyline holds the straight and the arc
     segments together; it is not split into separate entities.
  3. **Every polyline consumer handles arc segments** — rendering (drawn as a true curve),
     selection by picking on the curve, object snapping (endpoint, midpoint, nearest, centre,
     quadrant on the arc portion), extents, and length/area.
  4. **DXF/DWG round-trip.** Exporting a polyline with arc segments writes group-42 bulges on the
     `LWPOLYLINE`; importing one reads them back without tessellating. A straight polyline is
     written and read exactly as before.
  5. **`.gs` round-trip.** A polyline with arc segments saves and reloads unchanged. A `.gs` file
     written by an older build (no bulge data) loads with every polyline straight.
  6. **JOIN builds them.** JOIN of two lines sharing an endpoint produces one straight 2-segment
     polyline (unchanged). JOIN of a line and an arc sharing an endpoint produces one polyline with
     a straight segment and an arc (bulge) segment. Endpoints must be coincident within the
     existing JOIN tolerance; pieces that do not connect are left in place and reported by name
     (REQ-201), never silently dropped.
  7. **One undo step.** POLYLINE (however many mode switches) and JOIN each undo in a single step,
     restoring the pre-command drawing state.
- Acceptance:
  - Starting POLYLINE, typing `ARC`, picking a point, typing `LINE`, picking a point, and finishing
    yields exactly one polyline entity with one arc segment followed by one line segment.
  - The arc segment is tangent to the preceding segment at their shared vertex — the angle between
    the incoming segment direction and the arc's tangent there is 0 within 1e-4 rad.
  - `UNDO` during the command removes the most recent segment and the command continues drawing
    from the previous vertex.
  - A polyline containing an arc segment: renders as a curve (its tessellation stays within a
    chord-height tolerance of the true arc); is selected by a pick on the curved part; and reports
    endpoint / midpoint / nearest / centre / quadrant snaps on the arc part.
  - Its reported length equals the sum of the straight-segment lengths and the arc-segment arc
    lengths within REQ-101 tolerance; a hand-computed example (one 3-4-5 leg plus a quarter circle
    of radius 10) matches.
  - Saving that polyline to DXF and reloading reproduces every vertex within REQ-101 and every
    bulge within 1e-6, with no increase in vertex count.
  - Saving to `.gs` and reloading in a fresh process reproduces the polyline exactly; a pre-ADR-047
    `.gs` fixture loads with the polyline straight and no error.
  - JOIN of two lines meeting at a point produces one 2-vertex-pair straight polyline and removes
    the originals.
  - JOIN of a line and a tangent arc meeting at a point produces one polyline whose second segment
    has a non-zero bulge matching the arc's included angle within 1e-6.
  - JOIN of two objects whose nearest endpoints are farther apart than the JOIN tolerance leaves
    the drawing unchanged and logs which objects were not joined.
  - Undo immediately after POLYLINE, and after JOIN, restores the exact pre-command geometry
    (vertex count, positions, bulges) in one step.
- Owner-layer: Commands (POLYLINE draft + arc-option parsing, `ExecuteJoinSelection`) / Domain
  (`util/geom2d` `BulgeArc`, the polyline store rename) / Renderer (arc tessellation into the
  existing line path) / IO (`DxfIo` group 42, `GsIo` additive bulge array).
- Status: **accepted (2026-09-02)** — delivered in the four increments ADR-047 lists, each through
  its own PR and Verification pass.
- Revisions: 2026-09-02 — proposed and accepted (D-2026-09-02-e, ADR-047, TASK-180).

### REQ-317 — POLYSOLID: a wall swept along a path (GitHub issue #146)
- Purpose: REQ-313 gives GoSurvey seven solids, and every one of them is a shape from a formula
  placed at a point. None of them is the shape a surveyor draws most: a **wall** — a run of picked
  points given a thickness and a height. Curbs, retaining walls, footings, building footprints and
  jersey barriers are all that shape, and today each would have to be faked as a row of separate
  boxes that overlap at every bend and report a volume that double-counts every corner.

  It is deliberately **not** blocked on REQ-315. A general sweep runs an arbitrary profile along an
  arbitrary 3D path and needs freeform surfaces the kernel does not have; a polysolid extrudes a
  **rectangle straight up** along a **planar** path, so every face it makes is a plane or a cylinder
  — surfaces REQ-313 already integrates in closed form. That is why the most common sweep in survey
  work can ship while the general one waits for an architectural decision.
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Depends on: REQ-313. Uses `Surface::inward` (REQ-314 B2a) and the ear-clipping and annular paths
  REQ-314 added to the tessellator; adds neither.
- Statement: A `POLYSOLID` command creates **one** `brep::Solid` swept along a path in the active
  UCS. The path is a chain of **straight and circular** segments, drawn by picking points — the
  shape `PLINE` already establishes — or taken from an existing entity. The profile is a rectangle
  of a given **width** and **height**, extruded perpendicular to the work plane, and it is
  **justified** left, centre or right of the picked line.

  The path is offset to each side by half the width and **adjacent offsets are intersected**, so a
  bend produces a single mitred solid. It is not a row of boxes: a wall that turns a corner is one
  object with one boundary, one volume and one surface area, and the corner is counted once.

  A **straight** run sweeps into planar side faces; a **curved** run sweeps into cylindrical ones,
  because extruding a planar arc perpendicular to its own plane is a cylinder patch. The inner face
  of a curved run has its material on the far side from its own axis, which is the case
  `Surface::inward` already records for the wall of a Boolean bore.

  The solid is a first-class REQ-313 solid in every respect: it validates against the same
  invariants, reports volume and surface area from the same closed-form integrals, saves and
  reopens through the same `.gs` section, snaps, selects, erases and renders in all three visual
  styles, and carries a **recipe** naming what it was swept from.
- Acceptance:
  - `POLYSOLID` picks a **first point** and then further points, each committing a segment, with the
    candidate solid drawn live. `H` sets the height, `W` the width and `J` the justification
    (`L`eft / `C`entre / `R`ight) at any point in the command, before or between picks. Enter
    finishes an open path; `C` closes it; `U` undoes the last segment; Esc cancels by name and
    creates nothing.
  - `A` switches to **arc** segments and `L` back to straight ones. An arc segment is **tangent to
    the segment before it** and ends at the picked point, which determines it uniquely. An arc
    requested as the **first** segment is refused by name — there is no incoming direction for it to
    be tangent to — rather than guessed at.
  - `O` converts an **existing object**: a Line, an Arc, a Circle or a Polyline becomes the path,
    with the current width, height and justification. A closed source gives a closed wall with no
    end caps, and a polyline brings its **arc segments** with it (REQ-316's per-vertex bulges). An entity of any other kind is refused **by name**, and so is one that does not lie in
    the current work plane.
  - **The corners are mitred and the volume is honest.** For centre justification the plan area of a
    mitred wall is exactly `width × centreline length`, whatever angles it turns through — the
    triangle a mitre adds outside a bend is congruent to the one it removes inside — so the volume is
    `width × height × length` and is asserted against that closed form. Because a run of overlapping
    boxes sums to the same volume, the **surface area** is asserted with it: one wall carries two end
    caps where a row of boxes carries two per joint.
  - **A corner that cannot be mitred is refused by name and creates nothing** (REQ-201): a bend so
    sharp that the inner offset would run back past its own segment, a segment shorter than the
    mitre it would need, an arc whose inner offset radius reaches or passes zero (the wall would
    turn inside out around the curve), a doubled point, a closed path that does not return to its
    start, a non-positive width or height, and fewer than two points. A refusal **leaves the run
    open**, so the points already picked survive it and `U` can take back the one that caused it.
    start, a non-positive width or height, fewer than two points, and a justification or option
    letter that is not one of the listed ones. A refusal **leaves the run open**, so the points
    already picked survive it and `U` can take back the one that caused it.
  - **A path that crosses its own run is refused**, because the wall would enclose the same ground
    twice and its volume would count that ground twice. Detected exactly for paths made entirely of
    straight segments, where a rail is a polygon; with a curve in the path the check is **not**
    applied, because testing an arc by its chords would refuse walls that are perfectly fine and a
    false refusal is worse than the absence of a check. Note the contrast with the self-intersecting
    false refusal is worse than the absence of a check. The general case is the same Phase 4
    self-intersection test REQ-313 already defers. Note the contrast with the self-intersecting
    torus, which is *built* and merely withholds its mass properties: that is a shape people draw on
    purpose, and a wall crossing its own run is an authoring mistake.
  - **Height, width and justification are remembered** between invocations, the way AutoCAD
    remembers `PSOLWIDTH` and `PSOLHEIGHT`, and are saved with the drawing.
  - **Flat faces of any shape tessellate.** The kernel triangulates a planar face by ear clipping
    with hole bridging rather than by fanning from a centroid, so a non-convex top face and an
    annular one both mesh correctly. Asserted the way the primitives' tessellation already is: the
    triangles re-derive the face's own analytic area, every winding agrees with the face normal, and
    no triangle overlaps another. The seven primitives' meshes are asserted **unchanged in area,
    volume and winding** by the replacement.
  - A polysolid **saves and reopens** through REQ-313's `solids` section like any other solid, with
    its topology as the stored truth. Its recipe additionally carries the **path** it was swept
    from — the one recipe whose length is not fixed — written additively so a file with no
    polysolids is unchanged. A face's **outward direction** is written with it when it is inward:
    a curved wall's inner face is the first in the project whose material is on the far side from
    its own axis, and a file that lost that would reopen as a solid turned inside out.
  - A polysolid answers `SOLIDLIST`, object snap, selection, erase, undo and every REQ-064 visual
    style exactly as the seven primitives do, and every transform command refuses it by name for the
    same stated reason they refuse the others.
  - A polysolid is an ordinary **operand for the REQ-314 feature operations**: it slices, unions,
    subtracts and intersects like any other solid, asserted against exact volumes rather than against
    a returned success — a boolean that kept the wrong side succeeds too. A **curved** wall is
    refused by SLICE and by the B1 booleans, and that is REQ-314's own stated increment boundary
    rather than a gap here; the refusal is asserted **by name**, so it becomes visible the moment
    those increments lift it.
- Owner-layer: Domain (`src/util/brep.{hpp,cpp}`); Commands, IO and Viewport for the command,
  persistence and preview
- Status: accepted (2026-09-03) — see D-2026-09-03-d and ADR-050.

## Performance requirements

> Performance is a requirement, not an afterthought — but always paired with a
> *measurement method*. A performance requirement with no defined benchmark is
> not verifiable.

### REQ-318 — Sub-object picking: which face, edge or vertex is the cursor over?

- Purpose: a solid can be selected today, but only whole. Editing a solid directly — pushing a face,
  dragging an edge, rounding a corner — first requires naming the *part* of it under the cursor, and
  naming it precisely enough that the edit lands where the user pointed.
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Depends on: ADR-049 (the sub-object reference, and the single home for the pick), REQ-313 / ADR-045
  (the analytic faces that make an exact answer possible), REQ-314 / ADR-046 (the solids worth
  editing).
- **Starting state — stated plainly, because the issue and an earlier draft of this requirement both
  got it wrong.** The ray/triangle → `triFace` → `ClosestPointOnSurface` pipeline is **not new**.
  Object snapping has picked solid faces, edges and vertices since REQ-313 landed, in
  `src/viewport/CadSnap.cpp` (`RayHitSolidFace`, `ClosestRayPointToEdge`, `RayNearBounds`). What did
  not exist was any way for a *second* caller to use it: those helpers were file-private, so a
  selection subsystem would have had to re-implement them. This requirement is therefore about
  making one pick serve both, and about the selection concepts on top of it — not about teaching the
  program to hit a triangle, which it already could.
- Statement: given a cursor ray and a solid, the system reports the nearest **face**, **edge** or
  **vertex** of that solid, together with the point **on** that geometry, from one shared
  implementation used by every caller. The behaviour this requires:
  1. **One implementation, not one per caller.** The ray/triangle test and the broad-phase bounds
     reject live in one place and every pick routes through them. Two copies of a pick are two sets
     of numerics that can disagree under a single cursor — which is not hypothetical: the snap copy
     used an absolute determinant epsilon and exact barycentric bounds, so it fell through the
     hairline crack between two faces of the deliberately unwelded tessellation exactly where a
     scale-relative test with a barycentric slack reports a hit. A user would have seen the snap
     marker and the sub-object highlight name different things.
  2. **The reported point lies on the analytic geometry, never on a tessellation chord.** A face
     answer comes from the face's analytic surface, an edge answer from the edge's true curve —
     including an arc — and a vertex answer is the vertex itself. The tessellation is used only to
     find *which* sub-object; it never places the point.
  3. **Precedence is vertex, then edge, then face**, each within its own tolerance. Every vertex lies
     on an edge and every edge on a face, so a nearest-wins rule alone would make a vertex
     unpickable.
  4. **An occluded sub-object is not reported.** A vertex or edge more than its own tolerance behind
     the nearest *triangle* hit is on the far side of the solid. The baseline is the nearest
     triangle rather than the nearest usable face: a triangle whose face id is unusable still proves
     a front surface is there. Where the ray misses the solid's triangles entirely there is no front
     surface, so a near-miss just outside the silhouette may still take an edge or a vertex.
  5. **The tolerances are screen-derived and may be zero.** A vertex subtends a few pixels however
     far away it is, so the caller converts a pixel budget into world units at the pick depth, as the
     existing entity pick does. Zero disables that kind of pick rather than offering it at an
     arbitrary distance.
  6. **A pick that cannot be justified reports nothing** — a miss, a solid behind the cursor, a
     degenerate ray, or inconsistent inputs. No coordinate is returned rather than a plausible wrong
     one (REQ-201).
  7. **A pick costs no tessellation, and rejects cheaply.** The already-built display triangles are
     what is tested, behind a padded bounds test, so a pick stays inside REQ-100's frame budget on
     hover and the user picks the geometry they can actually see.

  **Increment 2 — the selection.** Items 1-7 answer *what is under the cursor*. What follows is what
  the program does with that answer: a selection the user makes, sees, and can act on later
  (D-2026-09-04-a).

  8. **Entry is `Ctrl` + click, and nothing else changes.** A plain click selects the whole solid
     exactly as it did before. Holding `Ctrl` selects the face, edge or vertex under the cursor
     instead. There is no mode to enter or leave, deliberately: a persistent sub-object mode is one
     a user can be left in without noticing, after which every ordinary click means something they
     did not intend.
  9. **The sub-object selection is its own store, and the two selections are mutually exclusive.** A
     plain click clears the sub-object selection; a `Ctrl` click clears the entity selection. Shift
     toggles within whichever selection the click addresses, keeping the meaning Shift already has.
     Nothing that consumes the entity selection — a transform, DELETE, the Properties panel, export
     — ever sees a sub-object, which is what makes "does not interfere" a structural property rather
     than a promise.
  10. **A sub-object reference expires; it does not re-bind.** It is an index *plus* the identity of
      the solid it came from (ADR-049). An index keeps its meaning across an edit that preserves the
      topology and loses it across one that changes the counts, so a reference whose solid has been
      replaced by a topology-changing edit is dropped rather than silently pointing at whatever now
      occupies that index.
  11. **What is selected is visible, and a face reads as a face.** A selected face is drawn as a
      tinted fill over its own triangles, an edge and a vertex as accent linework. **The face fill
      is depth-tested and the linework is not.** A never-occluded face tint would show a back face
      glowing through the body; an occluded edge or vertex would vanish into the surface it lies on,
      being one line or one dot thick. This is a deliberate exception to the blanket overlay rule
      ("a selection highlight that hides behind the object it is highlighting is a bug"), which was
      written for 2D linework and does not survive contact with a closed volume.

      In **2D Wireframe** — the default style, which draws no solid faces and runs with the depth
      test off — there is nothing for the tint to be occluded by and it simply draws. That is the
      intended behaviour, not a fallback: in wireframe the tint is the only way a face selection can
      be shown at all, and no nearer surface exists on screen to contradict it.
  12. **A whole selected solid is visible too.** It is drawn by its own edges, which is what the
      entity pick already tests against, so the highlight traces the thing that selects. Stated
      because it did not exist: before this increment a selected solid showed nothing whatever.
  13. **The highlight is built from the per-solid tessellation**, not from the coalesced display
      batches. Those merge solids that draw identically into shared buffers for REQ-100's draw-call
      budget and carry no per-face channel, so a face's triangles cannot be recovered from them.
  14. **While `Ctrl` is held, the sub-object under the cursor is shown BEFORE it is clicked** — a
      pre-highlight in a quieter treatment than the selection's, plus a rollover readout naming what
      would be selected and the properties of the solid it belongs to (D-2026-09-04-b).

      Not decoration. Precedence is vertex-then-edge-then-face within screen-derived tolerances
      (item 3), so which of the three a click will take is a function of the cursor's distance from
      geometry the user cannot measure by eye — on a box corner, a few pixels decide between a
      vertex, an edge and a face. Without the pre-highlight the only way to find out is to click and
      read the log, which makes every pick a guess and a correction. The whole-entity hover
      pre-highlight REQ-036 and REQ-039 already require exists for the weaker version of this
      problem.

      The readout follows the surface rollover REQ-089 established, including its **dwell**: it
      appears once the cursor comes to rest and goes when it moves, because a panel that tracks the
      cursor continuously obscures the geometry being picked. While `Ctrl` is held it takes
      precedence over the surface and survey-point readouts — `Ctrl` says the user is asking about
      solids.

      **The pre-highlight pick must not cost the frame budget.** It runs behind the same gate the
      entity hover pick already uses (a movement tolerance, a minimum interval, an idle cut-off), and
      the broad-phase bounds reject of item 7 applies to it unchanged.
- Acceptance:
  - a face pick on a cylinder reports a point on the cylinder of radius `r` **and at the azimuth the
    ray was aimed along** — both, because the projection makes the radius exact for any nearby input,
    so a radius assertion alone cannot distinguish a good pick from a bad one;
  - a face pick reports the nearest face, not the far side of the solid, from either direction;
  - a click near a corner reports the vertex; near a mid-edge, the edge; away from both, the face;
  - a click near a cylinder's rim reports a point on the rim's arc at radius `r`, not on a chord;
  - a curved edge that carries no sweep parameter is still walked as a curve;
  - a vertex or edge hidden behind a nearer face of the same solid is not reported, and remains
    unreported when the occluding triangle's face id is unusable;
  - a zero tolerance for a kind means that kind is never reported;
  - a ray whose direction is not unit length gives the same answer as one that is, and the reported
    depth does not scale with the direction's length;
  - a ray passing just outside the silhouette still reaches the solid's edges;
  - a ray that misses, a solid behind the cursor, a degenerate ray, a null result and inconsistent
    triangle buffers each report no pick and leave the caller's result untouched;
  - the snap path and the sub-object path give the same answer for the same ray, because they are
    the same code;

  Increment 2:
  - a `Ctrl` click on a face, on an edge and on a vertex each leave exactly that sub-object
    selected, and each is visible on screen;
  - a plain click on the same solid selects the whole solid and leaves the sub-object selection
    empty; a `Ctrl` click then leaves the entity selection empty — neither is ever populated at the
    same time as the other;
  - a plain click in the middle of a face selects nothing while a `Ctrl` click there selects the
    face — the entity pick tests edges only, and this states the difference rather than hiding it;
  - `Shift`+`Ctrl` click on an already-selected sub-object removes it and leaves the rest;
  - a `Ctrl` click that hits no solid clears the sub-object selection and starts no selection box;
  - with two solids one behind the other, a `Ctrl` click takes the nearer one's sub-object — the
    per-solid occlusion rule of increment 1 cannot see across solids, so the caller orders them;
  - a sub-object reference survives an edit that preserves the solid's topology and is dropped by
    one that changes it, rather than pointing at a different sub-object;
  - erasing the solid a sub-object belongs to leaves no dangling selection;
  - a selected whole solid draws a highlight — the case that did not exist before this increment;
  - the face fill is depth-tested and the edge and vertex linework is not, in the styles that have a
    depth buffer at all;
  - holding `Ctrl` over a face, an edge and a vertex pre-highlights each of them, in a treatment
    distinct from the selection's, and the pre-highlight names the same sub-object a click would
    take — it is the same query, so it cannot disagree;
  - releasing `Ctrl`, or moving off every solid, leaves no pre-highlight behind;
  - the rollover names the sub-object's KIND and the owning solid's colour, layer and linetype, and
    appears only once the cursor has come to rest;
  - a sub-object pre-highlight suppresses the whole-entity hover highlight rather than drawing both;
  - the pre-highlight pick runs behind the existing hover gate, not once per frame.
  - the pick's geometry and its refusals are all decided without a window or a document.
- Owner-layer: Domain (the pick query), UI/Commands (casting the ray, converting the tolerances, and
  what is done with the answer)
- Status: accepted — **increment 1 of 2 delivered** (GitHub issue #148, D-2026-09-03-c, ADR-049,
  TASK-189); **increment 2 specified and in progress** (D-2026-09-04-a, TASK-199). Increment 1 is
  the shared pick *query*: `ray3d::RayTriangleIntersect` and the new pure
  `src/util/solidpick.{hpp,cpp}`, with `CadSnap.cpp`'s two file-private copies refactored onto them
  so the divergence in item 1 cannot recur. Increment 2 is the *selection* — statement items 8-13
  above — which is where #148's acceptance criteria 1 and 2 are actually met.
- Revisions: 2026-09-03 — initial; increment 1 delivered. Same day, before merge: the "Starting
  state" note above added and the statement recast after review found the requirement had been
  drafted on the premise that solid faces were unpickable. They were not; the premise came from
  PR #180, which predates REQ-313 landing and was quoted without being re-checked against `beta`.
  2026-09-04 — increment 2 given a statement and acceptance of its own (items 8-13). It had a named
  scope and no criteria, which is a requirement that cannot be verified: the status line said what
  increment 2 *was about* while every one of the eleven acceptance bullets tested the query. The two
  behavioural choices it turned on — `Ctrl`+click for entry, and a depth-tested face fill against
  never-occluded edge and vertex linework — were put to the user and are recorded as D-2026-09-04-a.

### REQ-319 — Push/pull a solid's face: the first operation that EDITS a solid

- Purpose: Phase 5 is direct modelling — changing a solid by moving part of it rather than by
  re-entering the parameters it was built from. REQ-318 made a face nameable; this makes it movable.
  It is also the first operation in the kernel that takes an existing solid and returns a *changed*
  one: every operation before it built from a profile, combined two solids, or cut one.
- Priority: must
- Type: functional
- Depends on: REQ-318 / ADR-049 (naming the face), REQ-313 / ADR-045 (the analytic faces that make
  an exact answer possible), ADR-046 (d) (compute, validate, then replace).
- Statement: a **planar** face of a solid can be moved along its own normal by a signed distance,
  producing a new solid, when the geometry permits it. The behaviour this requires:
  1. **The face's own plane and its boundary move together.** The face's surface origin and every
     vertex its loops use translate by `distance × outward normal`. A neighbouring face keeps its
     surface and simply becomes taller or shorter, which is what makes a box's side stay a plane
     while its top rises.
  2. **It is refused unless every neighbour is a plane parallel to the push.** A neighbouring face
     whose surface is not a plane, or is a plane whose normal is not perpendicular to the push
     direction, would have to be **re-solved** rather than translated: its own vertices would leave
     its own surface. The operation refuses by name instead of producing that.

     **This precondition cannot be delegated to `brep::Validate`, and the case that proves it was
     measured.** Validate checks topology and degeneracy — closed shells, edges used twice with
     consistent orientation, no degenerate face or edge, finite coordinates, positive volume. **It
     has no check that a face's vertices lie on that face's surface**, and cannot cheaply: for a
     Boolean result that is a tolerance question, not a boolean one.

     With the precondition removed, pushing a **cylinder's flat cap** by 3 ft builds a solid that
     **Validate passes as Ok** and whose analytic volume is **863.938 against a true 1021.02** —
     15% wrong — because the wall's surface still reports `height = 10` while its top boundary sits
     at 13. A closed, manifold, positive-volume solid whose volume is a lie.

     A **slanted plane** neighbour — a wedge — Validate *does* reject, at every distance from
     0.001 ft up. There the pre-check buys not safety but an accurate sentence: without it the user
     is told "that push would turn the solid inside out or flatten it", which is false for a
     0.001 ft push on a wedge, and REQ-201 asks for a reason the user can *read*. Both halves are
     stated because the difference between them is exactly the kind of thing a later reader would
     otherwise have to re-derive.
  3. **A zero or non-finite distance is refused**, not treated as a no-op that reports success: a
     command that says it moved something it did not is worse than one that declines.
  4. **The result is validated before anything is stored** (ADR-046 (d)). A push that collapses the
     solid, inverts it, or degenerates a face is refused by name and the document is untouched. A
     push far enough to turn a solid inside out is a real user gesture, not a hypothetical.
  5. **The topology is preserved, so a sub-object reference survives the edit.** The operation moves
     geometry and changes no counts, which is exactly the case ADR-049 measured when it chose an
     index paired with the solid's identity. A push therefore leaves the pushed face still selected,
     and a second push continues from the first.
  6. **The recipe is dropped, never quietly updated.** A pushed box is no longer the box its recipe
     describes. ADR-045 already made the recipe optional and never consulted by validity, mass
     properties or tessellation; a recipe that no longer describes its solid is worse than none,
     because it reads as authoritative. `.gs` already stores topology rather than the recipe, so a
     pushed solid round-trips with no format change.
  7. **One undoable step.** The whole edit — including dropping the recipe and re-tessellating — is
     a single undo, and Ctrl+Z restores the prior solid exactly.
- Acceptance:
  - pushing a box's top face by `+d` gives a solid whose volume is the original plus `base area × d`,
    exactly, and whose face, edge and vertex counts are unchanged;
  - pulling the same face by `−d` returns the original volume within REQ-101, and pushing then
    pulling by the same distance restores the original geometry;
  - pushing a side face changes the volume by the *other* two dimensions' product times the distance
    — so the operation is not silently assuming a particular axis;
  - the pushed face's own plane moves with it: a point on the new face satisfies the new plane
    equation, not the old one;
  - a push that would collapse the solid to zero height or through itself is refused by name, and
    the input solid is returned untouched;
  - a zero distance, a non-finite distance, and an out-of-range face index are each refused by name;
  - a non-planar face — a cylinder's wall — is refused by name rather than approximated;
  - a face with a non-parallel planar neighbour is refused by name. A wedge's slanted face is the
    hand-checkable case: pushing the wedge's top would slide the slope's vertices off the slope;
  - a solid that has been pushed reports no recipe, and reloads from `.gs` with the pushed geometry;
  - the sub-object selection still names the pushed face after the edit, and a second push moves it
    again from its new position;
  - one Ctrl+Z restores the pre-push solid, geometry and recipe alike.
- Owner-layer: Domain (`brep` — the operation and its refusals), Commands (the command, the undo
  step, dropping the recipe), UI (the grip drag, a later increment)
- Status: accepted — **increment 1 of 2**: the kernel operation and a typed command that drives it
  from a sub-object selection. Increment 2 is the **grip drag** — a handle on the selected face that
  moves it with the mouse and previews the result live — which is #148's criterion 3 in the form its
  wording implies.
- Revisions: 2026-09-04 — initial (D-2026-09-04-c, GitHub issue #148 criteria 3, 7 and 8).

### REQ-320 — Import an ACIS 3D-solid block (analytic primitives, SAT only)

- Purpose: real-world vendor block libraries (Plant 3D piping/mechanical symbols) commonly store their
  only geometry as an ACIS `3DSOLID` entity; GoSurvey's DWG/DXF importer silently skips it today,
  producing an empty block definition with no error (GitHub issue #299, found while implementing #284).
- Priority: should
- Type: functional
- Depends on: REQ-313 / ADR-045 (the analytic `brep::Surface` kinds this maps onto), ADR-051 (the scope
  decision this requirement records), REQ-300 (no vendored ACIS/geometry kernel).
- Statement: importing a `.dwg`/`.dxf` entity of type `3DSOLID` whose ACIS payload is **SAT-encoded**
  (ADR-051 (a)) and whose body is a **solid lump** built only from **analytic primitive surfaces** —
  plane, cylinder (ACIS's zero-half-angle cone), or cone this increment, and only their **full-revolve**
  form (two full-circle rim edges, no seam) — sphere, torus, and a **partial** cylinder/cone revolve
  (whose u-span cannot simply be the full `[0, 2*pi)` a full revolve's can) are each a tracked
  fast-follow within this same requirement, not yet accepted (ADR-051 (b-1)) — and a planar face's
  boundary within the kernel's existing simple-polygon tessellation limit (ADR-051 (c)) — produces a
  real `brep::Solid` with
  `PrimitiveKind::None`, placed in `st.cadSolids` (and,
  when the entity lives inside a block definition, carried by `CadBlockContent::solids` so it survives
  `INSERT`/`WBLOCK`/`BLOCKIMPORT`, closing the same round-trip gap #284 fixed for 2D geometry).

  ACIS payloads or content outside that scope are **refused, never approximated or silently dropped**
  (ADR-051 (d), REQ-201): SAB encoding, free-form/blend/swept surfaces, sphere/torus surfaces (this
  increment), a curved face whose loop does not match a recognized shape, a wire or sheet (non-solid)
  body. The refusal names the entity's handle and the specific record or face
  that could not be represented, and reaches the log the same way an unrecognized entity type already
  does (`NoteSkip`) — the import completes with a message, not a silent empty result.
- Acceptance:
  - a `.dwg` block whose sole content is a single-primitive ACIS SAT solid (e.g. a plain cylinder or a
    box with a cylindrical bore) round-trips through `BLOCKIMPORT`: the resulting block definition's
    `CadSolid` has the expected face count, surface kinds and volume (within REQ-101) for the source
    shape;
  - the same solid inserted via `INSERT` and then `WBLOCK`'d back out survives with its solid intact;
  - a `.dwg` `3DSOLID` using SAB encoding is refused with a message naming the entity and "binary (SAB)
    ACIS is not yet supported" (or equivalent), and the rest of the file still imports;
  - a `.dwg` `3DSOLID` containing a spline/blend surface, or a face whose boundary does not reduce to a
    parametric rectangle, is refused with a message naming the entity and the specific face/record, and
    the rest of the file still imports;
  - a malformed or truncated ACIS stream is refused with a message, never a crash;
  - no third-party ACIS/geometry-kernel dependency is introduced (REQ-300).
- Owner-layer: IO (`src/util/AcisSatParser.*`, `src/io/LibreDwgCad.cpp`), Domain (`brep::Solid` is the
  target representation, unchanged), Commands (`CadBlockContent`/`CadBlocks.cpp` round-trip plumbing)
- Status: accepted — **increment 1 of 3**. SAB (#301) and free-form/blend/swept surfaces (#300) are
  separate, deferred increments; general trimmed-face boundaries are a kernel extension tracked
  separately (#302) and not a prerequisite here.
- Revisions: 2026-09-05 — initial (ADR-051, GitHub issue #299).

### REQ-321 — General trimmed-boundary faces (representation decision only)

- Purpose: `brep::Face` can currently only bound a face with the surface's own iso-parameter rectangle
  (`uStart/uEnd/vStart/vEnd`, REQ-313/ADR-045); a real-world imported solid (ACIS, per #299/#302) or any
  future feature needing an arbitrarily-trimmed face (general fillets, freeform sketch profiles) cannot
  be represented. This requirement records the representation decision only — no kernel behavior changes
  as part of it.
- Priority: should
- Type: architectural
- Depends on: REQ-313 / ADR-045 (the `Face`/`Loop`/`Edge` model being extended), REQ-315 / ADR-048 (the
  `SurfaceKind::Nurbs` parameter rectangle this must not conflict with), ADR-052 (the decision this
  requirement records).
- Statement: `brep::Face` gains an additive `paramLoops` field — a straight-line polygon in (u,v) space
  per existing `loops` entry (outer boundary plus holes) — that is **empty by default**, leaving every
  current primitive and Boolean-result builder's rectangle-form faces byte-identical in every consumer
  (`Validate`, mass properties, tessellation, picking). A non-empty `paramLoops` marks a face as
  **general form**, whose boundary for classification purposes (point-in-loop tests) is that polygon,
  while the authoritative 3D boundary curve remains the existing `loops`/`Edge` records unchanged. Only
  straight-line polylines are in scope; a curved boundary edge contributes finely-sampled points, and the
  procedural `Intersection` edge kind is out of scope (no producer needs it). Full detail in ADR-052.
- Acceptance:
  - `spec/architecture.md` records ADR-052 with status "accepted" and a decision date;
  - this requirement and ADR-052 explicitly name the follow-up order for #302's four consumer areas:
    #306 (data model + `Validate`) → #307 (mass properties) → #308 (tessellation) → #309 (picking), with
    #310 (ACIS import) as the concrete consumer that wires an importer into the new representation;
  - no file under `src/` is modified by this requirement — it is a recorded decision only, implemented
    by the follow-up issues above.
- Owner-layer: Domain (`brep` — decision only; the follow-up issues are the actual owners of the code)
- Status: accepted — design decision recorded; #306–#310 implement it.
- Revisions: 2026-09-05 — initial (ADR-052, GitHub issue #305, split from #302, split from #299).

### REQ-100 — Frame budget
- Purpose: interactive responsiveness (desktop/OpenGL)
- Priority: should
- Type: performance
- Statement: The viewport holds a **16 ms frame (60 FPS) at the 95th-percentile
  frame while continuously orbiting a 250,000-line-segment scene** on the
  reference machine. 250k segments is the density of a real topo with contours;
  continuous orbit is the worst case, because orbiting defeats any plan-view
  culling.

  The budget has **four cost profiles**, not one, and the bench carries a case for each:
  (a) **line segments** — 250,000, the original case; (b) **shaded meshes** — the REQ-063 density
  chosen for the bench (ADR-026); (c) **a surface** — **100,000 points / ~200,000 triangles,
  contoured and orbited**, which is a large but ordinary topo survey; and (d) **B-rep solids** —
  a few hundred tessellated primitives, orbited and shaded (REQ-313 / ADR-045 addendum (e)). A
  surface is its own profile because contours are regenerated display geometry (REQ-070) rather than
  stored vertices, so its per-frame cost does not follow from either of the first two. Solids are
  their own profile for the mirror-image reason: a solid scene is many small stream-uploaded batches
  with a cache lookup each, where the mesh profile is one large indexed upload, and those are
  different frames at the same triangle count. Profile (d) is also the only instrument that can catch
  the failure issue #120 names directly — "do not regenerate a solid's render mesh every frame" would
  show up here and nowhere else. **Triangulation and tessellation time are not part of this budget** —
  a surface rebuild runs off the UI thread (REQ-069) and is measured separately, and a solid's
  tessellation is cached on a staleness key rather than recomputed per frame.
- Acceptance: a committed benchmark scene profiled on the reference machine stays
  within budget at the 95th-percentile frame during a scripted orbit, **in each of the four
  profiles above**, **built with the toolchain named in `project.md` §7**. A frame budget is a
  property of a binary, not of source code: the compiler chooses the vectorisation, inlining and
  layout that decide it, so a figure measured with a different compiler is a different result.
- Owner-layer: Renderer
- Status: accepted — **profiles (a), (b) and (c) MET, measured 2026-08-15** (TASK-052, TASK-053);
  **profile (d), solids, MET, measured 2026-09-01** (TASK-169, D-2026-09-01-d, GitHub issue #194) —
  1.43 / 1.80 / 4.38 ms at 100 / 400 / 800 solids on the RTX 5060, cache held. The instrument
  (TASK-167) first showed it failing; coalescing the draw calls and giving the solid batches a
  persistent GPU buffer (the mesh-path fix) brought it well inside budget. Details below.
  **2026-09-01 (D-2026-09-01-d, GitHub issue #194): profile (d) MET.** The first run of the new
  instrument showed profile (d) FAILING — ~40 µs of fixed per-solid cost (one stream upload + one
  draw call for faces, another for edges, a cache lookup) made the p95 scale with the object count
  rather than the triangle total. Two things were done: (1) `RefreshSolidDisplayGeometry` now
  COALESCES — every visible solid sharing a resolved colour and edge lineweight is merged into one
  vertex buffer, gated on an assembly signature so an orbit reuses it; (2) the renderer keeps a
  PERSISTENT GPU buffer per coalesced batch, keyed on that signature with the same view-anchor-drift
  re-upload the imported-mesh path uses, so the timed orbit frames upload nothing and submit one
  draw call per appearance group. `BENCH SOLID` also now reports whether the tessellation cache HELD
  (`solidDisplayRegenCount`, the twin of the surface profile's `regenDuringRun`) — and a bug where
  the regen baseline was not reset between `BENCH` runs in one session was fixed (it had made a
  second run miscount its own scene-build tessellation as per-frame regeneration).

  On the **RTX 5060**, MSVC build, one `BENCH SOLID` per fresh session:

  | profile (d) | scene | p95 | verdict |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 100 solids | 244,000 triangles, Shaded | **1.43 ms** | MET — cache HELD |
  | 400 solids ("a real site model") | 976,000 triangles, Shaded | **1.80 ms** | MET — cache HELD |
  | 800 solids | 1,952,000 triangles, Shaded | **4.38 ms** | MET — cache HELD |

  The per-frame cost is now effectively flat in the solid count, in line with the mesh profile at the
  same triangle total — which is what a persistent indexed upload buys. Superseded (batching only,
  cache holding but still re-transforming + re-uploading every frame): 6.29 / 38.06 / 61.93 ms. Every
  figure recorded before 22:42 that day was measured on the **wrong GPU** (TASK-053 FINDING-3).
  GoSurvey exported neither `NvOptimusEnablement` nor `AmdPowerXpressRequestHighPerformance`, so on
  this hybrid laptop it rendered on the integrated Radeon 610M while `project.md` §7 names an
  RTX 5060. The machine was named and the compiler was named; the *device inside the machine* was
  not. Fixed by TASK-054 (BUG-013) — the application now asks for the discrete GPU.

  On the **RTX 5060** (forced via the per-application GPU preference), MSVC build:

  | profile | scene | p95 | verdict |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | (a) line segments | 250,000 | **1.38 ms** | MET |
  | (b) shaded meshes | 2,000,000 triangles, Shaded | **1.97 ms** | MET — the case exists as of TASK-053 |
  | (c) surface | 100,000 points / 199,966 triangles | **10.28 ms** | MET |

  **The budget is judged on the RTX 5060** (user decision, 2026-08-15), and the integrated-GPU
  figures are kept beside it as a **documented floor** rather than discarded — both are recorded,
  neither is quietly preferred. The floor is what a user sees on a machine whose discrete GPU is
  disabled or absent:

  | profile | RTX 5060 — judged | Radeon 610M — floor |
  |---|---|---|
  | (a) 250,000 segments | 1.38 ms | 9.27 ms |
  | (b) 2,000,000 triangles, Shaded | 1.97 ms | 21.40 ms — over budget |
  | (c) 100k-point surface | 10.28 ms | 9.32 ms |

  Judging on the discrete GPU is only coherent because the application now **asks** for it
  (BUG-013 / TASK-054, fixed 2026-08-15); before that fix the named reference device and the device
  actually used were different things, which is what made every earlier figure misleading. The floor
  row is why the fix matters: on the integrated GPU the mesh profile does not hold the budget.

  Note on (c): the surface profile is **CPU-bound**. It moved 9.32 → 10.28 ms between the two GPUs —
  slightly *worse* on the faster one — while (b), with ten times the triangles, runs at 1.97 ms. Its
  cost is per-frame regeneration of triangle edges, not rasterisation, and it is the only profile
  anywhere near the budget. Relevant before REQ-069/070/071 add contour regeneration on top of it.

  Superseded figures, all **integrated-GPU** measurements: 8.93 ms (clang, TASK-039, 2026-08-12);
  9.27 ms segments / 9.32 ms surface (MSVC, TASK-052, 2026-08-15); and the headroom sweep that put
  the segment ceiling between 500k and 750k. On the RTX 5060, 1,000,000 segments runs at 2.30 ms.

  Previously recorded here (retained for the audit trail):
  - (a) **line segments — MET**, p95 **9.27 ms** at 250,000 segments against the 16 ms budget;
  - (b) **shaded meshes — NOT MEASURED. `BENCH` has no mesh scene**, so this profile has no case to
    run. Predicted by TASK-041 §7 and still open; REQ-064's "budget met in Shaded" condition rests
    on the same gap. Until a mesh case exists, REQ-100 cannot be claimed in full;
  - (c) **surface — MET**, p95 **9.32 ms** at 100,000 points / 199,966 triangles. First measurement
    of this profile; it had no clang predecessor.

  Run it with the `BENCH` command (`BENCH`, `BENCH <segments>`, `BENCH SURFACE`, `BENCH MESH`); the
  scene generators and statistics are `src/util/benchscene.*`, and every run appends to
  `%APPDATA%\GoSurvey\bench-req100.txt`, **naming the profile it measured** (TASK-053).
- Revisions: 2026-08-11 — placeholder `<60 FPS / 16 ms>` / `<N>` replaced with a
  measurable budget, because REQ-058 makes framerate user-visible for the first
  time and R5 could not otherwise have a testable acceptance condition.
  2026-08-12 — reference machine named (it was undefined, which made the budget unreproducible);
  first measurement recorded.
  2026-08-12 — split into three cost profiles (segments / shaded meshes / contoured surface). ADR-026
  had already noted the budget "gains a second dimension" for meshes without writing it down; the
  surface case (REQ-068…072) is a third, and a single-number budget cannot be claimed by a feature
  whose cost profile it never measured.
  2026-08-15 — acceptance now names the toolchain, and the recorded measurement is marked invalid.
  The project pinned MSVC after discovering it had been building with clang against a spec that
  said MSVC (decision log). This is the same class of gap the 2026-08-12 revision closed for
  hardware: a performance number is meaningless without stating the machine, and equally
  meaningless without stating the compiler. Re-measure with `BENCH` and record the MSVC figure.
  2026-08-15 — re-measured under MSVC (TASK-052). Profiles (a) and (c) pass; (b) is recorded as
  **not measured** rather than assumed, because no mesh bench scene exists. The headroom claim is
  corrected from 3–4× to ~2× the required density: that number described a clang binary the project
  no longer ships, and leaving it in place would have understated the risk on weaker hardware.
  2026-08-15 (later) — profile (b) built and measured (TASK-053), and in the course of that the
  **device** question surfaced: every figure above had been measured on the integrated GPU. The
  acceptance conditions now need to name the GPU as they already name the machine and the compiler.
  A budget is a property of a binary on a device; this requirement has now been wrong about all
  three in turn, which is an argument for stating them, not for trusting the number.
  **Resolved the same day:** the budget is judged on the RTX 5060 with the integrated figures kept
  as a documented floor (decision log), and BUG-013 was fixed so the application actually requests
  the device the budget names — the requirement and the binary now agree about the hardware.

### REQ-101 — Numerical tolerance
- Purpose: domain correctness (CAD/survey)
- Priority: must
- Type: performance/quality
- Statement: A coordinate is **stored** and **computed** within **±0.01 ft** of the value the user
  supplied or the reference dataset states.

  "Stored" is not a redundant word here. Geometry is held `local` in `float`, with
  `world = local + worldDocumentOrigin`, so the error in a stored coordinate depends on the magnitude
  of the value at the moment it is narrowed to `float` — not on the arithmetic that follows. Narrowing
  a typed easting *before* the document origin is subtracted quantizes it at world magnitude: at
  easting 2e6 the `float` spacing is 0.25 ft, so `2000000.10` was stored as `2000000.125`, an error of
  0.025 ft that no later computation can undo. **The document origin is therefore established before a
  coordinate of large magnitude is narrowed**, so the narrowing happens at local magnitude and the
  same input stores within ~1e-4 ft.

  Establishment is bounded at both ends, and both bounds are load-bearing. Below
  `kLargeCoordinateRebaseThreshold` no frame is needed. Above
  `kMaxEstablishableOriginMagnitude` a value is not a coordinate, and building a frame around it would
  make garbage *representable* instead of refused — so it is left to the finiteness guards and
  reported (REQ-201).
- Acceptance:
  - the regression dataset passes at the stated tolerance (assert against tolerance, never exact
    float equality);
  - **a coordinate typed at state-plane magnitude is STORED within tolerance**, not merely computed
    within it — checked on a drawing whose document origin starts at `(0,0)`, which is the case that
    fails if the origin is established too late;
  - establishment is **one-time**: a second large coordinate does not move the frame again, since
    re-centring would round every stored coordinate through `float` on each move (the compounding
    drift REQ-079's idempotence condition forbids);
  - a magnitude too large to be a coordinate does not become storable by acquiring a frame — the
    refusal still happens and is still reported.

  **Picked points are scoped out of this tolerance, deliberately.** A viewport pick's accuracy is
  bounded by the pixel it came from, so at a usable zoom it is coarser than ±0.01 ft and no arithmetic
  downstream can improve it — the information was never captured. What *is* required is that picking
  add no error of its own: picks are submitted in **local** storage coordinates (not world — see
  `SubmitViewportPick`), and an object snap overrides the cursor with a value read directly out of the
  geometry stores, so **a snapped pick is bit-identical to the vertex it snapped to**. That is the
  property to protect, and it is why the pick path needs no widening to double. Exact values are
  entered by typing, which is what the conditions above govern.
- Owner-layer: Commands (`ParseWorldPointD`, the entry-time establishment), util/Commands
  (`CadCoordinateFrame`)
- Status: **accepted (2026-08-17)**
- Revisions: 2026-08-17 — accepted, and the template placeholders replaced with the measured rule.
  Promoted from `proposed` by decision **D-2026-08-17-b**, on evidence rather than on principle: a
  coordinate typed at easting 2e6 was being stored 0.025 ft off, which is 2.5x this requirement's own
  tolerance, before any commit, save or load. The requirement had stated the number since it was
  drafted but was unusable as authority while it stayed `proposed` — so the defect it describes could
  not be fixed without accepting it first. Scoped to **stored** as well as computed coordinates in the
  same change, because storage was where the violation actually was.

## Quality requirements

### REQ-200 — Deterministic, reproducible build
- Purpose: maintainability
- Priority: must
- Type: quality
- Statement: A clean build from a fixed commit produces identical artifacts and
  emits them to the build directory, never the source tree. Build dependencies
  are vendored in `third_party/` (D-2026-08-31-b) — their bytes are in the tree,
  not a ref resolved by a host at configure time.
- Acceptance: two clean builds of the same commit yield matching binaries
  (modulo timestamps).
- Owner-layer: Build/Platform
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: `<date>` — initial.
               2026-08-31 — D-2026-08-31-b: FetchContent dropped; deps vendored in `third_party/`
               (strengthens this requirement — the pins are now exact source, not refs).

### REQ-201 — No silent failures
- Purpose: debuggability
- Priority: must
- Type: quality
- Statement: Runtime failures are surfaced (returned status or logged error);
  programmer errors trip an assertion. No failure path is empty.
- Acceptance: code review confirms every error branch logs/returns; assertions
  guard invariants.
- Owner-layer: all
- Status: accepted
- Revisions: `<date>` — initial.

### REQ-202 — Releases are produced by the pipeline, not by hand
- Purpose: make a release an act of pushing, not a procedure to remember
- Priority: should
- Type: quality
- Statement: Building the installer is done by CI from a clean checkout, never from a developer
  workstation. Pushing to the repository builds, runs the test suite, and — depending on where it
  was pushed — packages and publishes:

  | Push target | Result |
  |---|---|
  | any other branch | build + test only; the installer job is skipped (run it on demand via `workflow_dispatch`) |
  | `beta` | build + test, then installer published to a **single rolling prerelease** tagged `channel-beta`, whose assets are replaced each time |
  | `master` | build + test, then version-gated stable release: tagged `v<version>` and published, **only if** that tag does not already exist |

  A push touching only documentation or governance (`**/*.md`, `docs/**`, `spec/**`, `workshop/**`,
  `verification/**`) does not run the pipeline. The `build`/`test` gate still runs on every push
  that touches code, on every branch (D-2026-08-31-a).

  The version gate is what makes "push to master" safe to do repeatedly: the release step is a no-op
  when `project(VERSION)` still matches the newest release, so a documentation push to master does
  not republish, retag, or re-notify users. Bumping the version *is* the act of releasing.

  Every published release carries the installer, a `latest.json` manifest (version, download URL,
  SHA-256, size, release notes), and nothing that the machine could not regenerate from the tagged
  commit. A failing test suite blocks publication.

  This is REQ-200 extended one step: REQ-200 says a clean build of a fixed commit is reproducible;
  this says the artifact users actually receive **is** that build, rather than whatever happened to
  be in a developer's `build/` directory.
- Acceptance:
  - a push to a feature branch runs build + test, creates no release and no tag, and does not run
    the installer job; `workflow_dispatch` on that branch still produces a downloadable installer;
  - a docs/spec/workshop/verification-only push runs no pipeline job;
  - a push to `beta` leaves exactly one `channel-beta` prerelease in the releases list regardless of
    how many times it is pushed, carrying the newest installer;
  - a push to `master` with an unchanged version publishes nothing and fails nothing;
  - a push to `master` with a bumped version creates tag `v<version>` and a stable release;
  - a failing `ctest` run publishes no release;
  - the installer's `AppVersion`, the release tag, and the manifest's `version` field are equal on
    every published release;
  - the manifest's SHA-256 matches the published installer.
- Owner-layer: Build/Platform
- Status: accepted (2026-08-15)
- Revisions: 2026-08-15 — initial. See ADR-029 and the decision log.
               2026-08-31 — D-2026-08-31-a (issue #142): installer job gated to beta/master/
               workflow_dispatch; docs/spec-only pushes skip the pipeline. The build+test gate is
               unchanged.

### REQ-203 — The command layer is drivable without a window
- Purpose: debuggability, maintainability — the interactive surface is the largest part of the
  system with no automated coverage, and it is where users actually meet the bugs
- Priority: should
- Type: quality
- Statement: The Commands layer runs to completion with **no window, no GL context, and no ImGui
  context**. A headless driver executes a **transcript** — a line-oriented text file of command-line
  submissions and viewport picks — against a real `AppCommandState`, and reports what the drawing
  became.

  Two consequences follow, and both are the point of the requirement rather than side effects:

  - **The Commands layer names nothing above it.** Architecture §2 says this already; today nothing
    enforces it, and one violation has accumulated (`LoadApplicationFont` in `CadCommands.cpp`
    reaches into ImGui). A headless target that must link makes the linker the enforcer, so the next
    violation is a build break instead of a review finding nobody happened to make.
  - **A transcript is a regression test.** A bug reproduced by hand once becomes a file that runs on
    every build, in the same form whether a human or a generator wrote it.

  The driver reads a transcript, writes a machine-readable result (entity counts, emitted log lines,
  invariant status), and exits non-zero on any failure. Reaching a native file dialog must not open
  one: the platform dialog functions are answered from the transcript.

  This requirement is about **drivability**, not about what is checked — the checks are REQ-204.
- Acceptance:
  - the headless target links with **no GLFW, no GLEW, no `gl*` symbol, and no ImGui backend** on
    its link line, and its binary imports no `opengl32.dll` — proven by the link line and by
    `dumpbin /DEPENDENTS`, not by inspection. *(Amended 2026-08-16: this condition originally said
    "no imgui". ImGui **core** is on the headless link line deliberately — loading a `.gs` measures
    label text through the current font and stores the result as geometry, so headless must measure
    it with the same font the GUI uses or the diff condition below is unmeetable. See the ADR-031
    amendment; the boundary that matters is no window and no GPU.)*
  - a transcript drawing a line, a circle, and a polyline yields exactly what a user performing the
    same steps yields, compared by saving `.gs` and diffing;
  - a transcript step that reaches a file dialog is answered from the transcript and never blocks;
  - a failing run exits non-zero naming the failure, the step index, and the transcript line;
  - the same transcript run twice produces byte-identical output;
  - the transcript corpus runs in CI on every push and a non-zero exit fails the build (REQ-202).
- Owner-layer: Build/Platform (the target), Commands (`ProcessCommandLineSubmit` /
  `SubmitViewportPick` as the driven entry points), Platform (the dialog seam)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-16)
- Revisions: 2026-08-16 — initial. See ADR-031 and the decision log.

### REQ-204 — Randomized command sequences are checked against document invariants
- Purpose: debuggability — find the state corruptions nobody thought to write a test for, and make
  each one arrive as a reproducer rather than as a user's description of a crash
- Priority: may
- Type: quality
- Statement: A generator produces REQ-203 transcripts from the command registry under a **seed**,
  interleaving commands, picks, cancels, undo/redo, and space switches, with coordinates drawn from
  a deliberately hostile distribution (NaN, infinity, 1e12, denormals, exact duplicates, collinear
  and zero-length geometry). After **every** step the driver evaluates a fixed set of invariants.

  The invariant set is the substance of this requirement. A fuzzer without oracles finds only
  crashes, and crashes are the shallow half of the problem:

  | Invariant | What a violation means |
  |---|---|
  | Undo then redo restores an identical document | The classic CAD defect class — an edit not fully captured by the snapshot |
  | `.gs` save → load → save is byte-identical | A field written but not read, or read but not written (REQ-079) |
  | DXF export → import → export is stable | An entity type silently dropped by an exporter with no branch for it |
  | No coordinate is NaN or infinite | Degenerate input propagating into stored geometry |
  | Local storage holds: `world = local + worldDocumentOrigin` | A world-coordinate value stored without subtracting the origin |
  | Flat-store strides hold (§11.8) | A 3D-widening regression, silently misreading every subsequent vertex |
  | Entity ids are unique and `nextEntityId` exceeds all of them | REQ-076 identity broken |
  | Every selection index is in range for its store | A stale index surviving a compacting erase (§11.9) |
  | Every submitted command emits at least one log line | REQ-201, checked rather than reviewed |

  A run is reproducible from its seed alone. A failing run is **automatically minimized** to the
  shortest transcript that still fails, and that minimized transcript — not the seed — is the
  artifact a bug report carries, because it survives changes to the generator.

  Fuzzing the **file parsers** (`DxfIo`, `GsIo`, glTF, STL, CSV) is the same requirement pointed at
  a different input: there the mutated thing is bytes of a seed file rather than a command sequence,
  and the oracle is "no crash, no hang, and a refusal is reported" (REQ-201).
- Acceptance:
  - the same `--seed N` twice produces an identical transcript and an identical result;
  - **each listed invariant has a fixture that deliberately breaks it and proves the check fires** —
    a check that has never failed is not known to be a check;
  - a failing run emits a minimized transcript that reproduces the failure standalone under the
    REQ-203 driver;
  - minimization terminates, is bounded in attempts, and reports its reduction ratio;
  - a clean run over a seed range exits zero and prints nothing but a summary;
  - the generator is TEST-ONLY: the shipped `GoSurvey.exe` neither links nor contains it (REQ-300).
- Owner-layer: Build/Platform (the target), Commands (the invariants' subject), util (the invariant
  checks themselves, pure)
- Status: accepted (2026-08-16)
- Revisions: 2026-08-16 — initial. See ADR-031 and the decision log. Delivery is staged
  (`docs/fuzz-harness.md` §8) and begins with the file parsers rather than the command driver.

### REQ-205 — Build stays fast enough to iterate on
- Purpose: maintainability — a build slow enough that developers batch changes or skip the local
  test run is a correctness risk, not just an annoyance (GitHub issue #142)
- Priority: should
- Type: quality
- Statement: The build is kept within a budget so the edit → build → test loop stays usable.
  Targets, on the reference dev machine and on the CI `windows-latest` runner with a warm
  dependency cache:

  | Measure | Budget |
  |---|---|
  | Clean `ninja-release` local build | ≤ ~2 min |
  | CI `build` job (warm dep cache) | ≤ ~6 min; ≤ ~10 min on a cold cache |
  | Incremental rebuild after touching one `src/ui/*.cpp` or `src/commands/*.cpp` | ≤ ~20 s |

  The means are not mandated, but the following are explicitly permitted and do **not**, on their
  own, require a further decision: splitting an oversized translation unit into cohesive units
  within the same subsystem and the same source list; a per-target precompiled header for stable
  heavy headers (`<Windows.h>`, `<filesystem>`, `nlohmann/json.hpp`, `imgui.h`); compiling a source
  file at most once per configuration by sharing objects rather than re-listing the file; and
  CI-side caching and path/branch filtering. A precompiled header is a build-time device only: it
  changes no artifact, and a source must still compile with the PCH disabled (the CI determinism
  check in REQ-200 builds without it, or an equivalent guard exists).

  This requirement never overrides REQ-200 (identical artifacts) or ADR-002 / ADR-031 (the test and
  headless targets link no UI/GL/Win32 translation unit): a build-time optimisation that would
  change a produced binary or pull a UI/GL unit into a pure target is out of bounds.
- Acceptance:
  - a clean `ninja-release` build on the reference machine completes within the budget above,
    measured (e.g. Ninja `-d stats` / `ninjatracing`, `sccache --show-stats`) and the figure
    recorded in the task log;
  - the CI `build` job on `beta` completes within budget on a warm cache;
  - touching one `src/ui/*.cpp` and rebuilding relinks only that unit and the binaries that use it,
    within budget;
  - two clean builds of the same commit still produce matching binaries (REQ-200 unaffected);
  - `GoSurveyTests` / `GoSurveySnapTests` / `gosurvey_headless` still contain no UI/GL/Win32 TU
    (existing checks unaffected).
- Owner-layer: Build/Platform
- Status: accepted (2026-08-31) — GitHub issue #142; see D-2026-08-31-a and the decision log.
- Revisions: 2026-08-31 — initial. Accepted the same day (D-2026-08-31-a) after Phase 1 (PCH,
  CI gating) and the first Phase 2 slices landed green.

## Constraint requirements

> Restate the hard limits from `project.md` §7 as verifiable requirements so the
> review can fail a change that crosses one.

### REQ-300 — Dependency discipline
- Priority: must
- Statement: A new third-party dependency enters the build only after the
  three-question policy in `project.md` is answered affirmatively and recorded
  in the decision log. Dependencies are **vendored in `third_party/`**
  (D-2026-08-31-b), each with a `VENDORED.md` recording its upstream URL,
  tag/commit, and trim/rebuild recipe. Updating one is a deliberate commit that
  replaces the files under its directory.
- Acceptance: each dependency maps to a decision-log entry; each `third_party/`
  subtree has a `VENDORED.md` with a resolvable upstream ref.
- Status: accepted

### REQ-301 — Minimal abstraction
- Priority: must
- Statement: A new interface/trait/template/generic is introduced only with two
  or more present-day concrete uses.
- Acceptance: review names the two call sites, or the abstraction is removed.
- Status: accepted

Each corner now carries its own work-plane elevation (`selBoxAnchorZ`, published through `uiCursorWorldZ` rather than threaded through five call sites). Invisible until now because Z does not move a PLAN projection and is genuinely 0 on the world XY plane at elevation zero — and because `headless.req058-orbited-fence-elevation` is the FIRST transcript to orbit the view at all, via a new `VIEWANGLES` driver verb. That is the wider finding: every REQ-058 behaviour that only exists off plan view had no failing test available to it. Negative-tested — restoring the Z = 0 projection reports `SELECTED: expected 1, got 0`
| REQ-059 | UI | planned — manual (+Z / −Y / an off-axis handle animate correctly and settle < 0.5 s; gizmo tracks the camera after orbit; clicks outside the gizmo still pick geometry). Appearance is ImOGuizmo stock — the mockup is not the target (amended 2026-08-11) | accepted |
| REQ-060 | UI/Commands | planned — manual (translate/rotate/scale each apply and undo in one step; gizmo result matches the typed command within REQ-101; no gizmo with an empty selection) | accepted |

| REQ-064 | Renderer/UI/IO | planned — 2D Wireframe **pixel-identical** to pre-change (the parity gate, as REQ-058 had); occlusion correct in Hidden/Shaded; lighting follows the camera; style change does not alter geometry/selection/snap/plot; REQ-100 met in Shaded | accepted |
| REQ-065 | IO/Domain/UI | planned — exact triangle count; bbox within REQ-101 after unit scale; doubly-nested node transform hand-verified; names + base colours survive; skipped features reported not silent (REQ-201); malformed file leaves drawing unchanged; state-plane precision within REQ-101 | accepted |

| REQ-056 | Commands/UI/Viewport/IO | manual (fresh profile: TRIM prompts for a trim line and two clicks trim + end; `TRIMSTATE 1` restores cutting-edge picking and survives a restart; bare `TRIMSTATE` shows the value, blank Enter keeps it, `TRIMSTATE 2` refused; T/L switch mid-run; hover pre-highlights a candidate edge, picked edges stay highlighted, an already-picked edge does not double-highlight) | accepted |
| REQ-055 | UI/IO | manual (File > New and File > Open land on the new tab with 2+ tabs open; "+" likewise; closing a tab focuses its replacement; pan/zoom survives save → close → reopen, including on a state-plane drawing that rebases on load; a pre-REQ-055 `.gs` opens framed to its drawing) | accepted |

| REQ-069 | Domain/util/Commands | planned — `TinBuildTests` (breakline appears as an edge and nothing crosses it, vs hand-computed edges; outer clip / hide void / show restore; <3 non-collinear points fails with no partial surface; crossing breaklines at different Z diagnosed) + manual (point move rebuilds with no user action; one MOVE of N points = one rebuild; undo during an in-flight rebuild discards it; deleting a breakline entity removes the definition item) | accepted |
| REQ-070 | Domain/Renderer/UI/IO | planned — interval change does not re-triangulate and adds no entity to drawing or `.gs`; shared style edits both surfaces; major-not-a-multiple-of-minor refused; deleted style falls back to default; `.gs` round-trip | accepted |
| REQ-071 | Commands/Domain | planned — extracted vertices within REQ-101 of edge interpolation; two extractions independent; rebuild leaves extracted polylines untouched; count + interval reported; contours-disabled extraction creates nothing and says so | accepted |

| REQ-076 | Domain/IO | planned — `EntityIdTests` (id survives erase of another entity, undo/redo, copy/paste, `.gs` round-trip; reference to an erased entity resolves to nothing, not to its index successor; paste yields a new id; legacy load is deterministic across two loads; no reuse within a session or across save/load) + the `EraseCadAnnotationAtIndex` fixup loop deleted, not duplicated | accepted |

Was: planned — `UpdateCheckTests` (version ordering across the prerelease boundary incl. `0.5.0-beta.2` < `0.5.0-beta.10` < `0.5.0`; equal/older yields no update; manifest parse of a good document, a malformed one, and one missing required fields; channel → URL selection; stable never selects a prerelease) + manual (network unplugged = no dialog, no delay, no error; second launch inside 24 h issues no request; setting off issues no request) | accepted |
| REQ-078 | UI/Platform/IO | `UpdateCheckTests` (skip suppresses that version but not a later one — green 2026-08-15); the download / hash / unsaved-guard / install paths are implemented but **unexercised — no manifest has been published yet**, and no real upgrade has been performed (TASK-050 ASSUMPTION-1). Was: planned — `UpdateCheckTests` (skip-state suppresses that version but not a later one) + manual (nothing downloads without a click; corrupted download fails the hash, is deleted, and is reported; dirty drawing hits the unsaved-changes modal and cancel aborts the update; after install one `GoSurvey.exe` remains, old `GoSurvey-0.*.exe` gone, shortcuts + `.gs` association still resolve; killed mid-download then retried succeeds) | accepted |
| REQ-202 | Build/Platform | **six of seven conditions observed against the live pipeline, 2026-08-20** — evidence per condition in TASK-049 §9, which cites the run ids: feature branch → artifact only, no release, no tag (run `31912058476`); repeated `beta` pushes → exactly one `channel-beta` prerelease across ~20 pushes; unchanged version on master → publishes nothing, fails nothing (run `32049139096`); bumped version → `v<version>` tag + release (`v0.5.0`, `v0.5.1`, `v0.5.2`); tag == AppVersion == manifest version (v0.5.2 checked three ways); manifest SHA-256 matches the asset (re-derived from the downloaded installer, byte-identical, `size` too). **Outstanding: failing ctest → no release has never been observed** — no run has failed at Test; the nearest evidence is run `31910767883`, which failed at Build and published nothing, so the gate is confirmed only in the negative (TASK-049 debt (5)). Status stays `accepted` rather than MET for that reason. Was: planned — observed pipeline behaviour (feature branch → artifact only, no tag; repeated `beta` pushes → exactly one `channel-beta` prerelease; unchanged version on master → no publish, no failure; bumped version → `v<version>` tag + release; failing ctest → no release; tag == AppVersion == manifest version; manifest SHA-256 matches the asset) | accepted |

| REQ-203 | Build/Platform/Commands | planned — the `gosurvey_headless` link line carries no imgui/glfw/GLEW/`gl*` symbol; a hand-written transcript (line + circle + polyline) saves a `.gs` identical to the same steps performed in the GUI; a queued `DIALOG` answer satisfies a file-dialog call with no block; a deliberately-broken transcript exits non-zero naming invariant + step + line; the same transcript twice is byte-identical; CI runs the corpus per push | accepted |
| REQ-082 | UI | planned — manual (header click sorts + marks the column, second click reverses; equal keys stable; after sorting, edit/delete act on the record shown; header frozen while scrolling; unchecked checkbox visible; saved file order unaffected by display sort) | accepted |
| REQ-081 | UI | planned — manual, side-by-side against the Hazel reference shots (adjacent docked panels separated by a visible border; panel surface lighter than the dockspace ground; recessed fields; Dark shows no `#464646`/steel-blue chrome; Dark→Light→Dark leaves no colour behind; Light pixel-unchanged; viewport contents unchanged; X/Y/Z badges present, Radius has none) | accepted |
| REQ-083 | Platform/UI | `PointFileExtTests` **green 2026-08-17** (5 cases / 26 assertions: a name ending `.csv`/`.txt` in any case gets nothing appended; a bare name gets the chosen filter's extension; a name ending in something else — `points.dat`, `job.2026` — still gets one; empty name; a trailing dot) + manual (Import chooser lists `.txt` under the default filter; the same bytes as `.csv` and as `.txt` import identically and validate identically; a locked `.txt` shows the REQ-041 message with Import disabled; a space-delimited `.txt` reports column errors and adds no point; Export typed as `points.txt` writes `points.txt`) — **the manual half was run and confirmed by the user in the application 2026-08-18**: the Win32 chooser and the REQ-041 file-state path cannot be linked by the test target, and `IMPORTPOINTS` only opens the window (the import is a panel button) so the REQ-203 driver cannot reach it either. Fixtures for the pass: `samples/points-req083.{csv,txt}` (byte-identical) and `samples/points-req083-spaced.txt` | accepted |
| REQ-204 | Build/Platform/Commands/util | planned — `--seed N` twice is identical; **one deliberately-broken fixture per invariant proving each check fires**; a failing run's minimized transcript reproduces standalone under the REQ-203 driver; minimization terminates within its bound and reports its ratio; a clean seed range prints only a summary; `GoSurvey.exe`'s link line contains no generator symbol | accepted |
| REQ-091 | Platform/Auth/UI | `AuthPingTests` **green 2026-08-23** (10 cases / 124 assertions: PKCE verifier charset/length/uniqueness, base64url encode+decode incl. round-trip and RFC 4648 vectors, authorize-URL parameter/percent-encoding correctness including `audience`, silent-refresh-vs-interactive decision) + **live end-to-end, real Auth0 tenant, 2026-08-23**: Google sign-in completed, loopback redirect caught, settings panel showed "Signed in as `<email>`", menu-bar email display confirmed; one real defect found and fixed live (Auth0 rejects a wildcard loopback port — ADR-037 (b) amended to a fixed candidate-port list, D-2026-08-23 amendment); silent-refresh-keeps-user-signed-in path requires "Allow Offline Access" enabled on the Auth0 API (user found this off, turned it on) — re-verification of the full 30-day-persistence path is the user's next manual step | accepted |

| REQ-080 (amended) | Telemetry/Auth/UI/Platform | `TelemetryPingTests` **green 2026-08-23** (email-empty/email-present JSON cases; `DecideEventToSend` simplified to install-vs-always-active, throttle tests removed with the throttle) + `telemetry-worker/test.mjs` **green 2026-08-23** (valid/empty/malformed email stored-or-dropped-to-null; column-count assertions 8→9) + **live, 2026-08-23**: deployed Worker smoke-tested with a real POST carrying `email`, confirmed via direct D1 read-back; live migrations applied to the pre-existing deployed table (`ALTER TABLE pings ADD COLUMN email TEXT`, `DROP INDEX ux_pings_active_daily`) | accepted |
| REQ-093 (amended) | UI/Platform | **manual, verified live against the real app across three build-and-look rounds, 2026-08-23 (D-2026-08-23-h):** the splash is its own small window (~440x320), centered on the primary monitor, filled edge-to-edge by the card — the real desktop, not a dimmed backdrop, is visible everywhere outside that small window; a native-resolution 32x32 corner logo (no upscaling — the source art is only that large) plus a large centered "GoSurvey" wordmark; the progress bar visibly animates across a hardcoded 5.0 s regardless of how fast real preload finishes; the main CAD shell is not shown/interactive until the 5 s elapses; user settings/prefs, the startup workspace template, the app font and the app logo are all loaded before the main shell is usable — this was already true pre-splash and REQ-093 does not change *what* loads, only that a splash now covers it; the splash's rotating phase text is cosmetic labeling only, since linetypes have no data table to load and text styles are already resident in memory the instant `AppCommandState` is constructed; closing the window during the 5 s exits cleanly with no hang; **the user's saved dock layout is restored correctly on launch** — this became an explicit acceptance condition only after a regression destroyed it once (D-2026-08-23-h) | accepted |
| REQ-102 | Domain/Renderer/Commands/UI | proposed — not yet scoped; catalogued from Known Limitations 2026-08-23 (D-2026-08-23-i) | proposed |
| REQ-103 | Commands/Domain/UI | planned — sequenced into 8 increments (D-2026-08-23-j); TASK-094 (MIRROR, step 1), TASK-095 (LENGTHEN, step 2), TASK-096 (EXTEND, step 3, model+paper space), TASK-097 (BREAK, step 4, model+paper space), and TASK-098 (STRETCH, step 5, model+paper space, full arc-parity geometry) all self-verified 2026-08-24, transcripts green (565/565 regression, plus 4 new unit tests pinning the arc-stretch formula). **All five then failed in model space**: none was routed in CadUi.cpp's model-space viewport click dispatch, so every click was silently discarded and each command hung on its first prompt (working in floating model space and pure paper space, which route separately). Fixed by TASK-099, which moved the routing decision into the pure `ViewportClickRouteFor` (viewport/ViewportPickPolicy.hpp) as an exhaustive switch with no `default:`, added the headless `CLICK` verb so a transcript exercises the routing the `PICK` verb bypasses, and converted the five REQ-103 transcripts onto it (red before the fix, green after; 571/571 regression). Two further GUI-only defects then surfaced and were fixed: LENGTHEN refused any pick made before its sub-mode had a value, making the ribbon button a dead end (TASK-100 — the pick now latches the object, reports its length and prompts, with Total as the new default sub-mode), and BREAK gained a live preview of the material a break removes, on its own opaque render channel because the shared translucent preview batch is invisible when painted over the object it describes (TASK-101). Both amendments recorded as D-2026-08-24-e / D-2026-08-24-f. **Steps 1-5 are complete**: 573/573 regression green, and the user confirmed the manual GUI pass on 2026-08-24, closing TASK-094..101. **Step 6 (FILLET/CHAMFER) is complete**: TASK-102 (FILLET, step 6a) and TASK-103 (CHAMFER, step 6b) both self-verified 2026-08-24 — full model+paper-space parity for both, tangent-arc/corner-point geometry unit-tested (8 + 3 cases), four headless transcripts (two CLICK-driven), two real bugs found and fixed during TASK-102's self-verification (triple undo-snapshot per apply; pick-based rather than computed-point-based near/far endpoint selection) — both fixes live in shared code, so CHAMFER's own transcripts passed on the first run rather than repeating either mistake. 588/588 regression green; manual GUI pass pending for both (this project's own no-UI-automation constraint). Steps 7-8 (ARRAY/EXPLODE) not started | accepted |

| REQ-118 | Commands/Viewport | planned — `headless.regression-118-polyline-close-enter` (click the start vertex closes; Enter ends open with no closing segment; two vertices refuse to close; CLOSE/END still work; Esc leaves nothing; model, 3DPOLY and paper space each asserted). Same feature/issue (#80) as REQ-303 below, built independently on `beta` — see REQ-303's duplication note, D-2026-08-25-l | accepted |
| REQ-119 | UI/Commands | **increment 1 done** (TASK-111) + **increment 2 done** (TASK-112) — `CommandLineTests [req119]` (the prompt→variants rule as a pure function: inline, grouped, mixed-case shortcut extraction incl. `No trim`→`N`, unclosed bracket, empty group, and a round-trip so parsing loses no text) + `headless.regression-119-variant-token-accepted` (the mechanism's three prompts) + `headless.regression-119-variant-coverage` (one assertion per marked-up token across CIRCLE/ROTATE/SCALE/TRIM/POLYLINE/FEATURELINE/ELEV, **plus a live refusal assertion for CIRCLE's bare `d`** — a value prefix, not a token, deliberately left unmarked so markup cannot manufacture a dead link) + manual GUI (links render, hover and click in BOTH the floating bar and the classic dock; a wrapping dock prompt keeps its links on the correct line with no horizontal overflow; **no log line is clickable**) | accepted |
| REQ-120 | UI | **manual GUI only, and that is a real limitation, not a shortcut.** The headless driver models no framebuffer and never calls `ProcessPendingViewportZoom` (which early-returns on `fbW <= 0`), so it cannot reach any zoom behaviour — there is no existing zoom transcript in the corpus for the same reason. Covering this by transcript would mean giving the harness a synthetic viewport, which is harness work this requirement did not take on (recorded as TASK-113 DEBT-1). Verified instead by driving the real window: middle double-click frames the drawing in model space; it works MID-COMMAND with the active LINE's placed point surviving; the typed route still does not zoom mid-command (its text is consumed by the active command as point input — unchanged); paper space frames the sheet; middle-DRAG still pans. Leaves GitHub issue #88 open — covers only #88's Middle Mouse/Architecture sections, not its ZOOMEXTENTS acceptance list | accepted |
| REQ-307 | UI/Commands | done (GitHub issue #106, D-2026-08-26-g, TASK-120). Closes REQ-121's own stated paper-space scope boundary for the one case that needed it: `StartPaperMoveCopyViewports`/`StartDeleteCommand`'s paper branch, on an empty selection, now sets `paperMoveWaitingSelection`/`paperDeleteWaitingSelection` and opens a real selection step instead of refusing — pick-first (act on an existing selection) is unchanged, above. `PaperIsObjectSelectionStep` (`ViewportPickPolicy.hpp`) is the paper-space counterpart of REQ-121's own predicate, consulted alongside it at every one of REQ-121's three call sites: the pickbox cursor (`CadUi.cpp`'s crosshair draw), the pre-existing (previously unconditional) paper snap glyph, and `CommandInputHint`'s prompt — all three now return REQ-121's own `kSelectObjectsPrompt` for this step, reusing the string rather than declaring a second one. Enter is handled by two free functions, `ProcessPaperMoveWaitingSelectionEnter`/`ProcessPaperDeleteWaitingSelectionEnter` (`CadCommands.cpp`), called from BOTH the raw viewport `ImGui::IsKeyPressed(Enter)` check (mouse-only entry, the same shape EXTEND's own paper phase already needed since paper commands never set `cmd.active` and so are unreachable from `ProcessCommandLineSubmit`'s Kind-keyed dispatch) AND a new branch at the top of `ProcessCommandLineSubmit`'s blank-line handler — the second call site is what gives this a headless transcript path EXTEND's raw-only precedent does not have, and the two call sites are guarded against double-firing on one keypress with `ImGui::GetActiveID() == 0` (the raw check only fires when no ImGui widget, e.g. the command-line box, currently holds keyboard focus). Click/box accumulation reuses `SelectViewport`/`TogglePaperEntitySelection`'s own pre-existing `additive=true` parameter verbatim — no new toggle logic — and a new `closePaperSelBoxMerge` lambda (a union variant of the pre-existing `closePaperSelBox`) merges a closed box into the accumulating selection rather than replacing it, mirroring REQ-305's model-space `SelectionAccumulate` (D-2026-08-25-l). Tests: `ViewportPickPolicyTests [req307]` (the predicate, pure and header-only); `headless.req307-paper-selection-step`, driven through the real `CMD DELETE`/`CMD MOVE`/`CMD COPY` and blank-`CMD` command dispatch (not CLICK/BOX — paper space's ambient click block is screen-space/ImGui-hover driven with no headless equivalent, the same limitation REQ-121's own paper DELETE/JOIN branch already had), proving the old flat refusal is gone and REQ-201's "Nothing selected" refusal holds on repeated blank Enter. The click-toggle/box-merge accumulation itself, the pickbox rendering, and the snap-glyph suppression are GUI-only verification, same category REQ-121 itself already established for its own three rules — this session cannot simulate mouse hover or screen-space picking. 637/637 ctest green | accepted |
| REQ-308 | UI/IO/Platform | planned (D-2026-08-30-a/b/c, TASK-147). Start tab as a non-document sentinel at drawing-tab index 0 — non-closable, non-reorderable, skipped by save-on-switch / dirty enumeration / close; `FirstDrawingTabIndex()` mediates drawing-tab indexing. `DrawDrawingViewport` branches to `DrawStartScreen` for index 0. New `gosurvey-recent.json` MRU store (`RecentDrawings`, best-effort, corruption = empty). Thumbnails captured from the drawing `ViewportRenderer` FBO on save/open, stored as BMP under the user data dir with LRU eviction (`ThumbnailCache`); missing thumbnail falls back to the DWG icon. GitHub Pages link via `ShellExecuteA` (already used by `auth`). Signed-out branch reuses `cmd.authSignInRequested` | accepted |
| REQ-311 | Domain | done (GitHub issue #145, D-2026-08-31-e, TASK-159). `ucs::Ucs` IS the plane abstraction #120 asks for — no second type was added (REQ-301). `src/util/ucs.hpp` gains `Point2D`, `WorldToPlane` (off-plane distance an explicit output, never dropped), `PlaneToWorld`, `SignedDistanceToPlane`, `ProjectOntoPlane`, and `PointOnPlaneCircle` — the one place a planar curve's parametrisation is written down, so renderer, hit test, snap and DXF writer cannot disagree about which way a tilted curve winds. `ray3d::Plane` stays the origin+normal ray-casting form. Tests: `UcsTests [req311]` (7 cases, 90 assertions: world-frame reduction, tilted survey-magnitude round trip to 1e-9, signed-distance sign on a 45° plane, projection residual is exactly the normal component, a circle on a vertical plane, and the parametrisation/conversion agreement) — negative-tested by flipping the sin sign, which goes red | accepted |
| REQ-312 | Domain/Commands/Render/IO | done (GitHub issue #145, D-2026-08-31-f, TASK-159). Arcs and circles carry a plane normal, defaulting to world +Z, so every existing entity, call site and test is unchanged — `ucs::FromNormal` reproduces the world X and Y axes EXACTLY for a +Z normal, which is what lets every per-vertex loop keep its pre-REQ-312 float arithmetic behind an `IsFlatNormal` guard and still agree to the bit. An arc carries `nx/ny/nz` in `CadArc`; circles use a `userCircleNormals` side-car (3 floats each) rather than widening the 4-float stride ~300 call sites read directly, maintained at the ~89 sites that already maintain `userCircleAttrs` and checked by `docinvariants` (REQ-204) — including the block-definition counterpart `CadBlockContent::circleNormals`, so BLOCK/BEDIT cannot silently flatten a tilted circle. A curve's frame is built in ONE place (`CurvePlane`) and sampled in one place (`CurvePointAt`), so the renderer, the rubber-band preview, the transform ghost, four object-snap walks, both bounds walks, block flattening and the DXF writer cannot disagree about where a tilted curve goes. Authoring is the active UCS work plane, no new command (ASSUMPTION-2, validated): CIRCLE and ARC were solving the radius, the circumcircle and the commit elevation in the XY PROJECTION, so a vertical work plane collapsed the radius to zero and read three rim picks as collinear. The commit and the preview now share `CadSolveCircleFromRimPick` / `CadSolveCircleThreePoints` / `CadSolveArcThreePoints`, deleting the preview's parallel circumcircle, sweep rule and tessellation. MIRROR/ROTATE/ALIGN transform the normal, and the arc's start angle is RE-MEASURED from a known moved point (`CadReanchorArcStart`) rather than transformed: `startRad` lives in a frame rebuilt from the normal, so the world-XY angle rules track it only while the arc is flat — measured, a mirrored wall arc came back a quarter turn out inside its own plane (TASK-159 ASSUMPTION-3, invalidated by its own test). DXF: export writes the real 210/220/230 **at `%.17g`** and the centre in the OCS frame group 210 implies; import reads them and refuses a zero-length 210 (REQ-201) instead of taking it as flat, which closes a live silent-import defect — until now a tilted ARC or CIRCLE from any other program arrived flat and misplaced with no message. The precision is not a style choice: group 210 is the one DXF value whose error is ANGULAR, and a probe over 400,000 normals with centres to +/-2e6 put six decimals **65.4 ft** out (REQ-101 is +/-0.01) and `%.9g` at 0.009 ft with no margin left. `.gs` persists the normal as additive `nx/ny/nz` on an arc and `circlesN` on the document, OMITTED when world +Z — that omission is the whole mechanism by which a legacy drawing re-saves byte-identically, and `IsFlatNormal` compares EXACTLY so a normal 1e-9 off +Z cannot re-save as flat. Scoped out, each recorded rather than left silent: INTERSECTION/APPARENT INTERSECTION and TRIM/BREAK against a tilted curve (planar-XY conic and planar boolean geometry — tilted curves are EXCLUDED from the candidate set rather than flattened into it, since a flattened answer lies on neither curve); OFFSET of a tilted curve; a tilted circle's box-selection and DXF-header bounds staying the conservative `cx +/- r` square (larger than the true footprint, never smaller, and identical to what `ComputeWorldExtents` computes, so writer and reader still agree — arcs needed the real fix because their XY bounds came out too SMALL); and the DWG entity layer, which carries no extrusion direction (REQ-175 / ADR-044 territory, wants its own issue). **All seven acceptance bullets met**, the snap one after a recorded rewording (2026-09-01): it originally named QUADRANT and NEAREST, which `CadSnap::Kind` does not have at all and which no accepted requirement asks for — they are a NEW requirement in the object-snap family, not a shortfall here. Every mode that does exist (Endpoint, Midpoint, Center, Perpendicular, Intersection, ApparentIntersection, Grip, Surface) is plane-aware and covered from an orbited pick RAY. Tests: `UcsTests [req312]` (2), `CadSnapTests [CadSnap][req312]` (4, driven through `FindBest` with a pick ray), `DocInvariantsTests [docinvariants][req312]` (3), and four transcripts — `headless.req312-arbitrary-plane-curves`, `-tilted-curves-drawn-and-edited`, `-dxf-arbitrary-plane-roundtrip`, `-gs-plane-persistence` (244 steps) — with new driver verbs `CLICKUCS`, `EXPECT CIRCLEXYZ`, `EXPECT ARCPOINTS`, `EXPECT FILECONTAINS`/`FILELACKS`. Every assertion negative-tested against the line that makes it pass. 864/864 ctest green. Not covered by test, stated plainly: the tilted DRAW path (`AppendArcVcDashed`/`AppendCircleVcDashed` per-vertex-Z chains) and the rubber-band preview are pixels, not geometry — GUI verification | accepted |
| REQ-309 | Commands/UI/IO | planned (GitHub issue #144, D-2026-08-31-g, TASK-162). Makes REQ-058's already-complete perspective maths reachable: nothing in `src/` assigned `Camera::projection`, `PERSPECTIVE` was not a command, and `GsIo` persisted `azimuthDeg`/`elevationDeg` but not `projection`/`fovDeg`. Adds `viewportProjection`/`viewportFovDeg` to `AppCommandState` and `DrawingDocument` (per-drawing, like the azimuth/elevation pair beside them), threaded through `CadViewCamera`; `PERSPECTIVE` and `FOV` commands follow the `VS` report-or-set shape (REQ-064); `NamedView` carries both so REQ-106 cannot restore a perspective view as orthographic. Legacy `.gs` defaults to orthographic. Paper-space projection explicitly out of scope — REQ-061's per-viewport camera does not exist. Tests: `CameraTests [req309]` (WorldToScreen/ScreenRay round-trip under perspective; ortho unchanged), `headless.req309-perspective-projection` | accepted |
| REQ-313 | Domain | accepted, increment 1 of 2 delivered — see the increment 2 row below (GitHub issue #146, D-2026-09-01-b, ADR-045, TASK-166). New pure `src/util/brep.{hpp,cpp}` — the first solid kernel in the project. **Increment 1 changes no existing source file**: the only edits outside the new module and its test are two CMake source-list entries, so it cannot regress anything, which is the whole reason the split exists. Topology is solid -> shells -> faces -> loops -> edges -> vertices with directed edge uses; every face carries an ANALYTIC surface (`Plane`/`Cylinder`/`Cone`/`Sphere`/`Torus`) and every edge a `Line` or `Arc`, so a whole sphere is one face and its volume is `4/3 pi r^3` by integration rather than a facet sum that would drift with display settings and miss REQ-101. Curved surfaces are seamed into faces that each bound normally (cylinder 2 halves, sphere 2 halves, torus 4 patches) precisely so "every edge bounds exactly two faces, once each way" stays an invariant rather than a special case — it is what `Validate` leans on hardest. Volume uses the rotation-invariant divergence form about the mean of the vertices; that reference point is the entire answer to survey-magnitude stability, since every integrand stays at model scale at easting 3.5e6. `Validate` adds a **geometric** closure probe (the same volume integrated about two reference points must agree) which catches what no topological check can: a curved face whose parametric span disagrees with its own boundary loop is manifold, orientable, ring-closed — and a hole. That probe is what makes the reference-point terms load-bearing; measured, not assumed, since on a closed surface those terms provably cancel (a deliberately flipped sign left the suite green, and deleting them turned four cases red including the span case). Cylinder is the `r0 == r1` case of the cone integral, so one derivation serves both. `ucs::Ucs` is the only frame type (REQ-311); no second plane type. Tests: `BrepTests [brep][req313]` — 19 cases, 313,221 assertions: seven primitives asserted against closed-form volume and area to 1e-12 plus expected V/E/F and Euler characteristic (0 for the torus, not 2); placement and rotation invariance; state-plane magnitudes for box, tilted sphere and torus; every construction refusal by name; six deliberately-broken topologies; the geometric-closure case; edge parametrisation endpoints on tilted frames; and a tessellation cross-check that re-derives volume and area from the triangles alone, confirms every winding agrees with its analytic normal, confirms finer tolerance means more triangles and less error, and confirms bounds contain the mesh. 955/955 ctest green. **Increment 2 (issue #146 stays open for it):** `CadSolid` entity + store, the seven commands with exact typed dimensions, `.gs` persistence, REQ-064 render path, cached tessellation against the REQ-100 budget, face/edge snapping, and ADR-045 (i)'s DXF/DWG exclusion message. Stated scope boundaries: no after-the-fact self-intersection test (refused at construction instead; general test is Phase 4's), no centroid or moments (#120 Phase 6), and plane faces triangulated as a centroid fan — correct for every face the primitives make, refused by name for anything else | accepted |
| REQ-313 (increment 2) | Commands/IO/Renderer/Viewport | accepted, delivered (GitHub issue #146, D-2026-09-01-b, ADR-045 addendum, TASK-167). The half a user can reach. `cadSolids`/`cadSolidAttrs` on the document, the undo snapshot and `AppCommandState`, held as `shared_ptr<const brep::Solid>` so a snapshot is a refcount bump (§11.5, the `CadMesh`/`CadTin` precedent); `EntityKind::Solid` and `SelectedEntity::Type::Solid` both APPENDED so the id sweep cannot renumber existing drawings. The one store held in `double` rather than `float`, and the exception is argued rather than taken: §11.8's convention exists for arrays headed for a vertex buffer, and narrowing a handful of B-rep vertices would discard the exactness the closed-form volume rests on for nothing — the tessellation, which really is GPU-bound, is narrowed in exactly one place. **Commands:** BOX/WEDGE/PYRAMID/CYLINDER/CONE/SPHERE/TORUS, one typed line each (base point in the active UCS, then exact dimensions), plus SOLIDLIST. The UCS supplies the orientation, so a cylinder gets an arbitrary 3D axis with no new command and no axis argument — REQ-312's rule for tilted arcs, applied. No interactive placement: that needs a 3D draft preview and is #120 Phase 5, stated in the usage text rather than left as a prompt that never comes. **Render:** solids draw in EVERY style, the opposite of ADR-026 (e)'s mesh rule and for ADR-026 (c)'s own reason — a solid HAS edges. Hidden writes the faces depth-only with `glColorMask` off and then the edges, which is real hidden-line removal; the polygon offset is load-bearing, since an edge lies exactly on its face and without a bias half of every silhouette drops out in speckles. **Cache:** keyed on `(solid pointer, chord tolerance)` and nothing else — a solid is immutable, so an unchanged pointer means unchanged geometry, and the early-out precedes any allocation (§11 invariant 7). Outside every undo snapshot, as ADR-036 (e) put the surface cache. `BENCH SOLID` adds REQ-100 profile (d); the instrument is delivered, the NUMBER IS NOT TAKEN — a frame budget needs the GUI on the reference machine, recorded in REQ-100's own status rather than assumed from profile (b). **`.gs`:** a `solids` section carrying the TOPOLOGY, not the recipe — a Phase 4 boolean has no recipe and must still save. Additive, omitted when empty (byte-identical legacy round trip), validated on load and refused with the kernel's own reason. Frames reuse REQ-154's `UcsFrameToJson` pair, whose reader refuses a non-orthonormal frame, so a hand-edited file cannot present a skewed surface frame that would silently shear a solid. **Snap:** vertices answer Endpoint and edge middles answer Midpoint (those toggles already mean that); new `Edge` and `Face` kinds behind ONE `objectSnapSolid` preference (REQ-301 — no unearned second option). A face hit is projected onto the analytic surface via `Tessellation::triFace` + `ClosestPointOnSurface`, so it lands on the cylinder rather than a sagitta short of it on the chord. **Selection:** click picks against the EDGES (what is drawn in every style, and all there is in 2D Wireframe); box selection uses the ANALYTIC bounds, because a sphere's two stored vertices describe almost none of it — a gap the visibility test found while it was being written, when a window drag selected nothing. Every transform refuses a solid by name (the Surface rule). DXF and DWG both name and count what they skipped. Tests: `CadSnapTests [CadSnap][req313]` (3 cases, 21 assertions) drives face and edge snapping through the real `FindBest` with a pick ray — a corner as Endpoint, mid-post as Edge, a face snap proven to land at exactly radius 10 rather than 9.99286 on the chord, nothing in mid-air, and nothing at all on an off layer. `BrepTests [brep][req313]` grows to 23 cases / 314,544 assertions (closest-point queries on all five surface kinds incl. a tilted survey-magnitude sphere, edge clamping, per-triangle face ids, edge tessellation); `headless.req313-solid-primitives`, 129 steps — seven primitives against closed-form volume/area and topology counts, twelve refusals, display batches, layer off/freeze visibility, box-select and erase with undo, a full `.gs` round trip, DXF exclusion, and a legacy no-solids file proven to omit the key. New driver verbs `EXPECT SOLIDPROPS`/`SOLIDKIND`/`SOLIDS`/`SOLIDBATCHES`/`SOLIDTRIS` and `LAYERSTATE`. 964/964 ctest green. **Two defects were found by the pre-merge review and fixed here.** (1) `ClosestPointOnEdge` clamped the raw `atan2` angle, so for a probe angularly outside an arc it returned whichever end had the smaller NUMBER rather than the nearer one — on a half-arc spanning [0,pi] a probe at -2.0 rad came back at the start, 2.0 rad away, when the end was 1.14 away. The answer was still ON the arc, which is why the original test (which only asked that) passed. Fixed by measuring the angle forward from the start in the sweep own direction, which removes the branch cut and makes a full-circle edge the case where nothing is ever outside. Masked in the snap path because a rim is split into two arcs that tile the circle, so one of them always contains the probe — now pinned as a stated property over 72 directions rather than a lucky one. (2) **Solids did not follow the document-origin rebase** (REQ-101): `ShiftAllStorageBy` had no `cadSolids` case, so a solid drawn at small coordinates before a state-plane coordinate was typed silently jumped by the origin whole magnitude — keeping its volume, area and topology throughout, so every existing assertion still passed and the wrong position was written to `.gs`. Fixed with a new `brep::Translate`, which lives in the kernel because only it knows every place a coordinate hides in a solid (vertices, each arc centre, each surface origin, the recipe frame); shifting only the vertices would leave a box right and a cylinder inside out. A new `EXPECT SOLIDBOUNDS` verb — the only one that says WHERE a solid is — pins it, and reverting the fix reports `mnX is 1999995.000000, expected -5.000000`. Negative-tested: dropping `faces` from the `.gs` write, disabling `SolidVisible`, mislabelling every triangle's face id, dropping the face snap's analytic projection (9.9928632694 instead of 10 — the sagitta exactly), and making the ray-bounds reject fire for everything each turn cases red. **Not covered by test, stated plainly:** the three visual styles are PIXELS — the batches reaching the renderer are asserted, the shading and the hidden-line result are GUI verification, the same category REQ-064 itself already established for its own styles; and REQ-100 profile (d) is unmeasured, above. **Follow-up (GitHub issue #194, D-2026-09-01-d, TASK-169):** the first `BENCH SOLID` run showed profile (d) failing at the reference density because the render path drew one stream-uploaded batch pair per solid — a fixed per-object cost linear in the object count. `RefreshSolidDisplayGeometry`'s assembly now COALESCES visible solids sharing a resolved colour and edge lineweight into shared vertex buffers (the `CadSurfaceDisplayGeometry` precedent), gated on an assembly signature so an orbit reuses them; `CadSolidDisplayBatch` owns its buffers rather than borrowing the cache's. A new `solidDisplayRegenCount` (twin of `surfaceDisplayRegenCount`) lets `BENCH SOLID` report cache HELD / NOT HELD, and the driver gains `EXPECT SOLIDVISIBLE` / `SOLIDTESSGEN` and `LAYERSTATE … COLOR` (`SOLIDBATCHES` now counts coalesced draw calls). No change to geometry, mass properties, `.gs`, snapping or selection; the p95 number still needs a reference-machine GUI session | accepted |
| REQ-313 (prompted form) | Commands/UI/Viewport | accepted, delivered (GitHub issue #146, D-2026-09-01-e, TASK-170). Amends increment 2 at the user's request: a BARE verb now opens a prompted command — base point (clicked or typed) then named dimensions by letter (`R` radius, `H` height, `L` length, `W` width, `T` top/tube radius, `S` sides) — where it previously printed usage. `R 4`, `R` then `4`, and a bare `4` filling the next unset dimension are all accepted; a value may be re-typed to correct it; Enter creates, Esc cancels by name, Enter with a required dimension unset NAMES what is missing, and a kernel refusal leaves the command open rather than discarding the base point and the values already given. **`CYLINDER 100,100 4 25` is unchanged** and still carries the "exact dimensions typed at the command line" acceptance. ONE `Kind::Solid` for all seven primitives, because they differ only in a data table (`CadSolidParamSpecs`) and not in control flow — seven near-identical state machines is the duplication that lets one quietly miss a fix. That table is read by BOTH the prompt and the commit, so a prompt cannot offer a letter the commit does not know; its ORDER is load-bearing twice over, being both the one-line form's argument order and the order a bare number fills. Both forms reach the same `brep::MakeX`. Integration guarded at each point a command can be silently forgotten: `ViewportClickRouteFor` (no `default:`, so the new Kind was a compile error until routed — the TASK-099 mechanism), `CommandInputHint` (REQ-304; computed, not a literal, because it echoes the values already set), `CancelActiveCommand`, and — the one that actually bit — **`ProcessCommandLineSubmit`'s blank-line block**, which consumes Enter before the Kind-keyed branch ever sees it, exactly as FEATURELINE's and UCS's own notes warn. Enter is what CREATES a solid, so the flow silently failed to commit until it was handled there. Tests: `headless.req313-solid-prompted` (105 steps) — the load-bearing one is **the two forms agreeing**, the same cylinder built both ways asserted to identical volume, area, topology and world bounds; plus an armed letter, bare numbers in order, a dimension corrected before Enter (20x5x8 = 800, not the 1600 the first width would have given), a CLICKED base point through the real route, a named missing dimension, a refusal leaving the command open, bad input at both prompts, and Esc leaving nothing behind with the next command starting clean. `ViewportPickPolicyTests` gains `K::Solid`. 966/966 ctest green. One pre-existing assertion updated rather than deleted — `req313-solid-primitives.txt` asserted a bare `SPHERE` printed usage, which is the behaviour this deliberately changes, and now asserts the prompt opens and Esc leaves the drawing untouched. Still out of scope, and the reason the original boundary existed: rubber-band drag preview, 3D grips, and transforming a placed solid (#120 Phase 5) | accepted |
| REQ-313 (picked dimensions) | Commands/UI/Viewport/Domain | accepted, delivered (GitHub issue #146, D-2026-09-01-f, TASK-171). Every dimension with a natural mouse gesture is now PICKED, with the candidate solid drawn live: a radius is a distance in the work plane, a height is the closest approach between the cursor ray and the solid's axis, and a box's or wedge's opposite corner sets length AND width at once from a first corner (AutoCAD's shape - the prompted form is corner-to-corner, the one-line form keeps its base centre plus explicit dimensions). Before the whole solid is determined the preview draws the BASE - a circle, a rectangle, or a pyramid's polygon TURNING with the cursor - which is the half that cannot come from the solid builder, because at a radius prompt there is no solid yet. Added with it: `D`iameter at every radius prompt (halved into the radius in exactly one place, so a diameter can never reach the kernel as a radius), `I`nscribed/circumscribed on the pyramid, 4 sides by default and a cone top radius defaulting to an apex, so a keyword-and-default dimension never blocks the pick sequence. **One builder**: `CadBuildSolidFromCommand` serves the preview, the click and Enter, because a preview computed separately from the commit eventually shows a solid the click does not build. **The cursor is resolved in the COMMAND layer** (`CadResolveSolidPick`), not the viewport - it is geometry, and that is what lets a transcript drive the same arithmetic the mouse does; the viewport supplies only the pick RAY, which is the one thing the domain cannot reach and the only way a height can be read off the screen (plan view has none, and says so instead of inventing a number). Pick order is DATA (`SolidParamSpec::pick`), and the table order is still the one-line form's argument order, so the argument order and count of `PYRAMID x,y S R T H` are untouched. A picked dimension that completes the set creates the solid; a typed one waits for Enter, preserving the correct-before-Enter case. **Pyramid radius parity (review fix):** the one-line form now reads a pyramid's base and top radius as the apothem (circumscribed, AutoCAD's default) via the shared `PyramidCircumradius`, the same reading the prompted form applies unless `I` is set — so `PYRAMID 0,0 4 6 0 15` and the prompted pyramid with base radius 6 build one identical solid (`req313-solid-prompted` asserts both forms, and the circumscribed one-line volume in `req313-solid-primitives` changed 360 -> 720). **Corner-anchor parity (review fix):** a typed length/width on a prompted BOX/WEDGE now anchors at the first corner in the positive direction, the same as a picked opposite corner — the prompt says "first corner" and the typed path no longer centres the box on that point instead. **ADR-045 (f) amended**: a torus whose tube EXCEEDS its ring is built - the self-intersecting shape AutoCAD makes - and only the exactly-equal case is refused, where the inner equator collapses to a point and the rim edges have zero radius. Such a solid reports NO volume or area (`brep::SelfIntersects` gates `ComputeMassProperties`, and both authoring forms print one shared message): a surface enclosing part of space twice makes `2 pi^2 R r^2` a number rather than an answer, and printing it would be the silent wrong answer REQ-201 exists to prevent. Tests: `headless.req313-solid-picked` (149 steps) - a full mouse-only cylinder; a radius picked off-axis at (3,4) proving it is a DISTANCE and not a copied coordinate; `D` inline and armed; a box corner dragged positive and negative; wedge; cone defaulting to an apex; pyramid circumscribed AND inscribed; torus ring and tube; the self-intersecting torus; Esc mid-command; and **the preview matching the commit** for a cylinder and a box. Three new driver verbs make the feature testable at all: `HOVER` (move without clicking - the preview is the half a CLICK cannot show, since by the time a click lands the rubber is gone), `EXPECT PREVIEWBOUNDS` (bounds rather than a segment count: a count proves only that something was drawn), and `VIEWANGLES`; `CLICK` gained an optional Z, because a height read off the RAY cannot be expressed by aiming at a plan XY. `BrepTests` gains the self-intersecting torus case. 969/969 ctest green. Negative-tested: resolving a radius as a coordinate reports `volume is 113.097336, expected 523.598776`; building the preview without the cursor reports `PREVIEWBOUNDS: mnX is 0.000000, expected -6.000000`. **Not covered by test, stated plainly:** the preview is asserted as GEOMETRY, not pixels - that it is drawn is a GUI pass, the same category REQ-064's styles sit in; there is no dimension text at the cursor yet; the wireframe still shows only topological edges where AutoCAD draws isolines (raised in the same request, sequenced as its own PR); and POLYSOLID does not exist (a new object needing a sweep operation, #120 Phase 4, its own REQ) | accepted |
| REQ-313 (isolines) | Domain/Commands/IO | accepted, delivered (GitHub issue #146, D-2026-09-01-g, TASK-172). The user's "make the wireframe look like AutoCAD and cleaner than what GoSurvey draws now". A solid's topological EDGES alone are a poor picture of it — a cylinder's are two rims and two seams, a sphere's are two meridians, so a sphere draws as a lens rather than a ball — which is why every CAD package draws curves ACROSS the curved faces. New `brep::TessellateIsolines`, emitting them from **the same analytic `SurfacePointAt` the shaded triangles use**, so an isoline and the shading beside it cannot disagree about where the surface is. Count is per FULL TURN (AutoCAD's `ISOLINES` semantics), default 4, set by an `ISOLINES` command in the report-or-set shape `VS` and `PERSPECTIVE` already use, clamped 0..256 with **0 legal** and meaning edges only; persisted in `.gs` and UserPrefs, clamped again on read, and added to the tessellation cache's staleness key so changing it actually redraws. **Directions are per surface kind, not a blanket rule**: cylinder and cone get rulings along the axis ONLY, sphere gets meridians AND latitude circles, torus gets tube AND ring circles, plane gets none — a horizontal ring part way up a cylinder is not something AutoCAD draws and reads as an edge that is not there, a seam or the join of two stacked solids. **The grid is global to the surface's frame and sampled STRICTLY inside each face's span**: every curved primitive here is split into half-faces at a seam (ADR-045 (d)), so a per-face grid would bunch the lines where two faces meet, and a non-strict test would put an isoline exactly on a seam edge that is already drawn. A sphere's latitudes are the one exception to the global grid and the exception is argued: its `v` is a latitude over [-pi/2, pi/2] rather than a full turn, so half that grid's lines would fall outside the surface entirely — evenly spaced interior latitudes at half the count instead. **Isolines share the edge buffer** rather than getting a batch of their own: they are the same colour and weight as the object, so a second stream would be another thing to keep in step for no visible difference — **the renderer needed no change at all**, which is the evidence the seam was cut in the right place. Tests: `BrepTests [brep][req313]` grows to 26 cases / 315,401 assertions — a cylinder gets exactly TWO grid rulings (the other two land on the seams, already edges) each a SINGLE straight segment since a ruled surface makes a chord exact; a sphere gets meridians and latitudes with every point at the radius; a torus's points are all at the minor radius from the ring's centre circle; a box gets NONE; zero is legal; more isolines means more curves and **never one on a seam**, asserted over every curve; bad tolerance and invalid solid refused like the other tessellators. `headless.req313-solid-isolines` (29 steps) covers the half the kernel cannot see: that the setting reaches the DISPLAY, that changing it changes the wireframe **and nothing else** (the triangle count asserted unchanged at 200 across ISOLINES 0/4/16 while the edge segments go 102/104/116), that bad values are refused with the setting left standing, and a `.gs` round trip. New count verb `EXPECT SOLIDEDGESEGS`; the counts are exact rather than approximate because the tessellation is deterministic. 971/971 ctest green. Negative-tested: suppressing the isoline call reports `SOLIDEDGESEGS: expected 104, got 102` — the two rulings, exactly. **Not covered, stated plainly:** no silhouette curves (AutoCAD also draws the true view-dependent silhouette of a curved surface; isolines are fixed to the object and do not move as the view orbits — a render pass, not geometry, and its own work); the wireframe is verified as GEOMETRY, not pixels, the same category REQ-064's styles sit in; and POLYSOLID still does not exist (the last of the three pieces, needing a sweep operation, #120 Phase 4, its own REQ and ADR) | accepted |
| REQ-317 | Domain/Commands/IO/Viewport | accepted, delivered (GitHub issue #146, D-2026-09-03-d, ADR-050, TASK-190). The last of the three pieces the user asked for with screenshots, and the scope they chose in full: straight AND curved segments, mitred throughout, plus `O`bject conversion. **Not blocked behind REQ-315**, and the reason is geometric: a general sweep needs freeform surfaces, but a polysolid extrudes a RECTANGLE straight up along a PLANAR path, so every face it makes is a plane or a cylinder — surfaces REQ-313 already integrates in closed form. `brep::MakePolysolid` offsets the path to each side by the half-width and INTERSECTS adjacent offsets — line/line solves two lines, line/arc a quadratic, arc/arc the radical line, all closed form and nothing iterative — so a bend produces ONE mitred solid. A box per straight run is far easier and wrong three ways: the runs overlap, the drawing holds N objects where the user drew one, and the volume double-counts every corner. A SMOOTH join is taken directly rather than solved for, because its two offsets are tangent and the intersection is a double root; every arc the command draws is tangent to the run before it, so that is the common path and not the exception. **Command:** its OWN `Kind::Polysolid`, not an eighth row in `CadSolidParamSpecs` — a path is a growing list, not a fixed set of named dimensions. Points picked or typed; `A`/`L` switch between arc and straight segments (an arc is TANGENT to the run before it and ends at the picked point, which determines it uniquely from one pick — PLINE's own rule; an arc asked for FIRST has no incoming direction and is refused rather than given one the user did not choose); `C` closes, `U` undoes one segment, `H`/`W`/`J` set the wall and are REMEMBERED between invocations and saved with the drawing (AutoCAD's PSOLWIDTH/PSOLHEIGHT), Enter finishes, Esc cancels by name. `O` converts a Line, Arc, Circle or Polyline — routed by `ViewportClickRouteFor` to a RAW entity pick at that prompt and a snapped coordinate at every other, a phase-dependent route like MOVE's. A source not in the current work plane is refused by name. A converted polyline brings its ARC segments across, REQ-316 having given the store per-vertex bulges: `tan(theta/4)` to `PathSeg::sweep` as `4*atan(bulge)`, the DXF convention both stores already share. ONE `CadBuildPolysolidFromCommand` serves the preview, the click and Enter. **Refusals** (REQ-201): a bend too sharp or a segment too short for the inner offset to turn, an arc whose inner offset radius reaches zero, a repeated point, a closed path that does not return to its start, and a straight-segment path crossing its own run — that last detected exactly for polygonal rails and deliberately NOT applied when the path has a curve, because testing an arc by its chords would refuse walls that are fine, and a false refusal is worse than no check (the contrast with ADR-045 (f)'s self-intersecting torus is deliberate: that shape is drawn on purpose, so it is built and only its mass properties are withheld). A refusal leaves the run OPEN so `U` can take back the point that caused it. **What this deliberately did NOT add is half the story.** It was written against a `beta` that moved a long way underneath it, and the rebase onto REQ-314's Phase 4 work deleted two of its three parts: a `Surface::sense` field of its own (REQ-314 B2a had already added `Surface::inward` for the wall of a Boolean bore — the same situation seen from the other side, with the same three application points — so the duplicate went and `inward` is reused; two flags meaning the same thing is exactly the disagreement ADR-045's "no reversed flag" rule existed to prevent), and a planar triangulator with hole bridging (REQ-314 had already taught the plane branch to fan a convex ring, ear-clip a non-convex one and strip a two-loop face by angle — so that went too, and with it the `req313-solid-isolines` triangle-count change it had forced). What survives is a builder and nothing else: no new surface kind, no new curve kind, no change to the tessellator, the integrals or the validity checks. Tests: `BrepTests` gains 9 cases `[req317]`. The load-bearing one is the mitred right angle: **volume 120 AND area 212**. The volume alone does not distinguish a mitred wall from a run of overlapping boxes — they sum to the same number, since a mitre gives back on the outside of a bend exactly what it takes on the inside — but the AREA does, because two boxes carry four end caps where one wall carries two. Plus a one-segment wall that is exactly a box, a closed rectangle checked as the difference of two prisms, a full ring checked against pi(11^2-9^2) with its inner faces asserted `inward` and its cap faces asserted to have two loops, a tangent arc join taken directly, justification moving the wall without resizing it, survey-magnitude stability, every refusal by name, and a triangle count (32) pinning that a swept solid's non-convex cap reaches REQ-314's ear clipper while its convex quads still go through the centroid fan. `headless.req317-polysolid` (147 steps) covers the half the kernel cannot see: a typed L-wall, a closed rectangle by `C`, `U` replacing one leg, **the preview matching the commit** (`PREVIEWBOUNDS` then `SOLIDBOUNDS` at the same place), a tangent arc, an arc refused as the first segment, Left justification, `O` on a Line, a Circle and an arc-carrying Polyline (asserted to give the same figures as the picked-arc wall, which pins the bulge conversion), both refusal classes with the run left standing, Esc, and a `.gs` round trip. `ViewportPickPolicyTests` gains `K::Polysolid` and its phase-dependent route. 1037/1037 ctest green. **Negative-tested four ways**, each turning something red: removing the mitre (4 BrepTests cases); restoring the centroid fan on the L-shaped cap (`Dot(Normalize(geo), n) > 0.0 with expansion -1.0 > 0.0` — the fan emitting triangles outside a non-convex face); building the preview without the cursor (`PREVIEWBOUNDS: the preview is empty`); and ignoring the arc tangent so a curved segment goes straight (`volume is 144.852814, expected 154.24778`). **One real defect was found by the round trip while it was being written**: the face-orientation flag was not written to `.gs`, so the ring wall reopened with its inner faces facing outward, failed the geometric closure probe and was refused on load — nine solids saved, eight read back. The probe ADR-045 added is what caught it, and no topological check could have: a shell with one face turned the wrong way is manifold, orientable and ring-closed. **Composes with REQ-314, measured rather than assumed**, since that is the whole value of putting a polysolid in the same `brep::Solid` as everything else: a doorway box SUBTRACTs out of a straight wall for 320-42=278 (its OVERLAP, not its volume - the box overhangs in Y and stops short in Z precisely so those two figures differ), UNION gives 362, a straight wall slices 160/160, a BENT wall slices 90/30 with the mitred corner intact in the larger piece, and a notch subtracts from a bent wall for 112. Figures rather than a returned `true`, because a boolean that kept the wrong side succeeds too; and the wall's own volume is asserted FIRST, so a regression in the builder trips before any of these and a regression in the operation trips after. A CURVED wall is refused with `SliceCurvedFace` and `BooleanCurvedFace`, asserted BY NAME: those are REQ-314's own increment boundaries (SLICE 3a is flat-faced, B1 takes uncurved operands), so when they lift, these assertions fail and say so rather than a curved wall quietly staying unusable. **Why this is NOT built on `Extrude`** is recorded as a test rather than an opinion, and the investigation removed half the reason from the CODEBASE rather than from the argument. It was two things. (1) `Extrude` refused an arc curving INTO its loop, which the inner rail of every bend is - that was ADR-046 (d)'s own "separate feature, now unblocked", this requirement's test is what pointed at it, and it has since been LIFTED (D-2026-09-03-b, REQ-314 amended). (2) `Profile` is a SINGLE loop where a closed wall's plan is an annulus with two, which is not going away by itself and is what the test pins now: extruding a ring wall's outer rail alone does not approximate the wall, it fills the courtyard in - a solid cylinder more than three times the wall's volume, and the gap between those two figures is the whole of the argument. **Not covered, stated plainly:** no self-intersection check on a path containing a curve (above); no editing of a placed polysolid's path — #120 Phase 5, alongside transforming any solid at all; and the preview is verified as GEOMETRY rather than pixels, the same category REQ-064's styles sit in. **Noticed, not fixed, and not ours:** a blank Enter after a LINE or CIRCLE chain re-arms that command, so the next verb typed is swallowed as a point — pre-existing, reproducible with `SPHERE` as readily as with `POLYSOLID`, and the transcript uses `Esc` rather than working around it silently | accepted |
| REQ-310 | Viewport/UI/Commands/IO | planned (GitHub issue #144, D-2026-08-31-h, TASK-162). 3D crosshair: the cursor's arms become the active UCS's X/Y/Z axes projected through `Camera::RightWorld`/`UpWorld`. Projection lives in a new pure header `src/viewport/Crosshair3d.hpp` (no ImGui, no GL, no `AppCommandState`) beside `ViewportPickPolicy.hpp`, so the screen-space sign conventions are testable without a window — a wrong sign still LOOKS like a 3D cursor. Axis hues defined once there and consumed by `UcsIcon.cpp` too, so icon and cursor cannot disagree. `viewportCrosshair3d` on `AppCommandState`, off by default; `CROSSHAIR3D` command in the `VS`/`PERSPECTIVE` report-or-set shape; Settings checkbox. Model space only; REQ-121's pickbox rule still wins. Tests: `Crosshair3dTests [req310]` (plan-view axis directions, rotated UCS, azimuth sweep, foreshortening, collapsed-Z, degenerate guard — negative-tested by flipping the screen-Y sign, 3 cases go red), `headless.req310-crosshair-3d` (command, refusal, `.gs` round trip **including OFF** — which caught a real defect: the key was originally written only when ON, so an absent key left the previous session's value) | accepted |
| REQ-121 | UI/Commands/Viewport | done (GitHub issue #91, D-2026-08-26-a + D-2026-08-26-d, TASK-115 + TASK-118). Mechanism: `ViewportIsObjectSelectionStep`, derived from `ViewportClickRouteFor`'s `default:`-less switch, so a command cannot be added and silently omitted — `ViewportPickPolicyTests [req121]` (4 cases: ALIGN's unsnapped corners — red before the fix; every selection step recognised; each exclusion asserted; DELETE/JOIN's route, with ZOOM and STRETCH left on the box route). Review follow-ups closed by TASK-118, re-derived while rebasing onto `beta` after issue #103 landed underneath it: rule (3)'s shared prompt was factually wrong for DELETE/JOIN — fixed by giving them D-2026-08-25-l's accumulate-until-Enter shape, covered by `headless.req121-delete-join-accumulate` (proven red on `beta`: the closing box erased, LINES 3 -> 2). Rule (1)'s reported second seam (the snap-OVERRIDE menu bypassing the gate) had its underlying mechanism replaced by #103 between the original review and this rebase — the "cursor jumps mid-selection" symptom no longer reproduces, because the override's consumption already sits behind the same `!ViewportIsObjectSelectionStep` gate the automatic snap uses; what remained was narrower (the menu could still be *opened*, arming a persistent lock off a selection-step pixel that then silently affected the next ordinary snap), and that is what TASK-118's rebase actually gates. The cursor/OSNAP/prompt rules themselves stay GUI-only — there is no headless equivalent for screen-space picking or for a drawn cursor — and both rounds were verified A/B against a control rather than by absence. Paper space is a STATED scope boundary, not coverage: its modify commands are pick-first, so no selection step exists there (GitHub issue #106 — closed by REQ-307, which gives MOVE/COPY/DELETE a real selection step for the one case that needed it, starting with nothing pre-selected). 634/634 ctest green post-rebase. One `CadSnapTests` case (issue #103, unrelated to this task) carried an em-dash in its Catch2 name that CTest's Windows discovery mangles into a filter matching nothing, reporting a false failure in CI on both this branch and unmodified `beta` (`425afa7`'s own CI run) — fixed here by renaming the test to plain ASCII rather than worked around, since it was blocking CI on every branch built from `beta`, not just this one | accepted |
| REQ-122 | Commands | done (GitHub issue #88, D-2026-08-26-c, TASK-117) — **automated**, which REQ-120 could not be. The framing arithmetic was hoisted into `src/commands/ZoomFraming.hpp` (pure + header-only, the `OrthoConstrain.hpp`/`ViewportPickPolicy.hpp` precedent) so `tests/ZoomFramingTests.cpp` can reach it without a framebuffer: 11 Catch2 cases / 231 assertions covering centring, fit-at-any-aspect, the 8% margin, aspect binding, the one-unit floor on degenerate extents, invariance above the floor, refusal on non-finite input, finiteness across spans 1e-9..1e12, corner order, and null out-params. 3 of the 11 proven red against the old constants before the fix. TASK-113's DEBT-1 is unchanged and still open — `ProcessPendingViewportZoom` itself remains unreachable from the harness — but every guarantee #88 asks for now lives in tested code. The state-dependent halves (empty drawing, live parity with the gesture, middle-drag pan) verified in the GUI, measured off the status-bar readout rather than eyeballed: typed ZOOMEXTENTS and the middle double-click produce identical world coordinates to 4 dp at two screen points. 622/622 ctest green | accepted |
| REQ-123 | Commands/UI | done (GitHub issue #100, D-2026-08-26-e, TASK-119) — **`headless.req123-viewport-zoom-extents`, the first zoom behaviour ever covered by a transcript.** TASK-113's DEBT-1 blocks the others on `ProcessPendingViewportZoom`'s `fbW <= 0` guard; this case needs no framebuffer (its aspect is the viewport's rect in paper inches) so it is handled ahead of that guard. 43 steps: the framing after ZE with hand-computed scales (13.5870 for an 8x4in viewport, 27.1739 for 4x4in — same drawing, different rect, different answer), each viewport independent of the other's zoom, and a layer frozen in the viewport excluded from the extents then restored when thawed. Proven red on `beta`: `expected centre 50, 10 scale 13.587; got 0, 0 scale 50` — the viewport's framing untouched at its creation defaults. Four new driver verbs (VIEWPORT / VPSELECT / CLAYER / VPFREEZE) and `EXPECT VPFRAME`, all REQ-203 gaps of the LAYOUT/CLIPCOPY shape. GUI pass confirmed the numbers against the live status bar (`VP 1" = 40.4'` vs 40.36 computed), the sheet unmoved, REQ-120's gesture working in a viewport for the first time, and middle-drag pan still confined to it. 632/633 ctest (the one failure is `beta`'s own — an em dash in a `CadSnapTests` TEST_CASE name breaks ctest's name round-trip; unrelated and pre-existing) | accepted |

| REQ-305 | Commands/Viewport | done (GitHub issue #87, D-2026-08-25-m, TASK-111 — relabeled from REQ-304/TASK-109 while merging `master` into `beta`, see the requirement's own header note). ARRAY (rectangular + polar) follows the MOVE/COPY/ROTATE/SCALE/MIRROR transform-command shape end to end; survey points excluded from the array selection, confirmed with the user (D-2026-08-25-m addendum). Amended once (D-2026-08-25-n, TASK-112): the shared "select objects" step was click-or-box-and-accumulate-until-Enter for MOVE/COPY/SCALE/ROTATE/MIRROR/ALIGN/ARRAY (STRETCH excluded — its crossing box is load-bearing geometry, REQ-103 step 5), replacing the box-only shape all seven originally shared. `GoSurveyTests.exe` 542/542, headless transcript corpus green (1 pre-existing disabled, unrelated) | accepted |
| REQ-318 | Domain/UI | accepted, increment 1 of 2 delivered — the SHARED pick query (GitHub issue #148, D-2026-09-03-c, ADR-049, TASK-189). **What was new is not what the issue claimed.** The ray/triangle → `triFace` → `ClosestPointOnSurface` pipeline already shipped with REQ-313, inside `src/viewport/CadSnap.cpp`; what it could not do was serve a second caller, because `RayHitSolidFace`, `ClosestRayPointToEdge` and `RayNearBounds` were file-private. So increment 1 is a *consolidation*: `ray3d::RayTriangleIntersect` and the new pure `src/util/solidpick.{hpp,cpp}` are the one home, and `CadSnap` now routes through both instead of keeping its own copies. That mattered concretely — the snap copy used an absolute determinant epsilon and exact barycentric bounds while the shared one is scale-relative with a barycentric slack, so on the hairline crack between two faces of the deliberately unwelded tessellation the two disagreed: snap reported nothing where a selection would report a hit, and a user would have seen the snap marker and the sub-object highlight name different things under one cursor. Above the geometry, what is genuinely new is the **expiring sub-object reference** (an index is durable across a topology-preserving edit and meaningless across one that changes the counts, so it is paired with a `weak_ptr` to the solid and expires rather than re-binding), and precedence and occlusion as stated rules. The projection remains the sharpest point and is measured: a raw triangle hit sits 0.00986 ft off a cylinder's true surface at the shipping chord tolerance — inside REQ-101's ±0.01 ft but 98.6% of the whole budget — and projected the residual is at the arithmetic floor. **The tests assert the picked AZIMUTH as well as the radius**, because `ClosestPointOnSurface` rescales any nearby point to exactly `r`: a radius assertion alone cannot fail for the reason it appears to test, and an earlier draft of this row cited one that could not. Occlusion is measured against the nearest *triangle* rather than the nearest usable face, so a corrupt face id cannot move the baseline to the far side of the solid; the ray is normalized on entry, because `RayTriangleIntersect`'s parameter scales as `1/\|dir\|` and `RayPointDistance`'s as `\|dir\|`, which on a non-unit ray makes the occlusion comparison meaningless rather than merely imprecise; and the curved-edge chord budget keys on the curve KIND, not on `sweep`, which a `CurveKind::Intersection` edge leaves zero. Increment 2 is the selection mode, its store, the highlight treatment and coexistence with the entity pick — where #148 acceptance criteria 1 and 2 are actually met. | `SolidPickTests` (21 cases: cylinder radius AND azimuth from 24 azimuths; the same oblique geometry passing at storage magnitude and failing at absolute state-plane magnitude, which pins the local-coordinates precondition with evidence rather than prose; near-face-wins from both directions; vertex/edge/face precedence; zero tolerance disables a kind; occluded far-side vertex refused, and still refused when the occluding triangle's id is corrupt; a non-unit ray giving an identical answer and an unchanged depth; a ray just outside the silhouette still reaching the edges; the rim picked on the true arc; and refusals for a miss, a solid behind the cursor, a degenerate ray, a null result, mismatched buffers and an empty solid) + `Ray3dTests` (10 new cases for the primitive, including a hit on a shared edge reported by both triangles and a 0.25 ft triangle at easting 2e6 — the case an absolute degeneracy epsilon would reject). The refactored snap path is covered by the existing `GoSurveySnapTests` and the `req313-solid-picked` headless transcript, both unchanged and green. Full suite 1062/1062. | accepted |

## Anti-requirements

- "We do **not** require pluggable rendering backends — OpenGL only until a

- We do **not** require screenshot diffing or golden images of the framebuffer. Pixel-level visual
  tests stay out (flaky; they mostly exercise ImGui/GPU, not GoSurvey).

  the real ImGui tree and is compile-excluded from Release. *(Anti-requirement amended 2026-08-29;
  original “no UI-automation at all” accepted 2026-08-16 with ADR-031 alt. (1).)*

- We do **not** require native Leica LGS/LGSX/BLK/BLKX/IMP/PTG/BIN or Autodesk RCP/RCS in File
  Format Specs (D-2026-08-29-g). Interchange for those workflows is E57/LAS from the vendor tool.
- We do **not** require IFC write, ODA membership, or DWG write past R2004 in this epic.
- We do **not** require point clouds as TIN data sources (REQ-068 D4 / ADR-042).
