/// ACIS SAT ("Standard ACIS Text") record parser (REQ-320 / ADR-051, GitHub issue #299).
///
/// Some vendor block-library `.dwg`/`.dxf` files (Plant 3D piping symbols, mechanical fittings) carry
/// their geometry as a single ACIS `3DSOLID` entity rather than lines/circles/polylines. LibreDWG
/// decrypts the container but hands back only the raw ACIS record stream — it never tessellates or
/// otherwise interprets it. This module turns that stream into a \ref brep::Solid, entirely in-tree
/// (REQ-300 forbids vendoring ACIS/OpenCASCADE/Parasolid): it reads the ACIS topology graph directly
/// (body -> lump -> shell -> face -> loop -> coedge -> edge -> vertex -> point) and maps its analytic
/// surfaces onto the existing \ref brep::SurfaceKind values.
///
/// **Scope (ADR-051), all by deliberate, recorded decision — not an oversight:**
/// - **SAT (text) only.** SAB (binary ACIS) is a different token framing of the same record model and
///   is deferred to GitHub issue #301. The caller (`LibreDwgCad.cpp`) is expected to check the DWG
///   `3DSOLID`'s `version` field and refuse SAB before ever calling this parser.
/// - **Analytic primitive surfaces only, and only plane/cylinder/cone this increment** (ACIS's
///   `cone-surface` also encodes a cylinder as its zero-half-angle case). `sphere-surface` and
///   `torus-surface` are recognized but refused — their loops can pinch at a pole or wrap a periodic
///   tube seam, a genuinely different shape than cylinder/cone's two recognizable loop patterns below,
///   and are a tracked fast-follow of this same feature rather than a hastily-generalized recognizer
///   (ADR-051 (b-1)). Free-form (`spline-surface`) and derived (blend/sweep/loft) surfaces are
///   deferred to issue #300 and refused here by name.
/// - **A cylindrical or conical face's loop must be a full revolve** (two full-circle rim edges,
///   `v0 == v1` on each, no seam) — its u-span is simply `[0, 2*pi)`. A **partial** revolve (a seam
///   line, an arc, a seam line, an arc) is recognizable but deliberately NOT accepted this increment:
///   its u-span has to be derived from the seam edges' actual angular position, a materially
///   different and separately-tested derivation, so it is refused by name and left as a fast-follow
///   of this same feature rather than landed without a fixture that exercises it. A general trimmed
///   loop is refused too; that is issue #302's kernel extension, not this parser's to solve. A planar
///   face's boundary has no such restriction (the kernel already tessellates an arbitrary simple
///   polygon of line/arc edges for a plane, per `Problem::PlaneFaceNotSimple`'s existing "no holes"
///   limit).
/// - **One lump, one shell, solid bodies only.** A `wire` body (curves, no faces) or a `sheet` body
///   (an open shell) is refused; a body with more than one lump or a shell with more than one sub-shell
///   is refused. These are all real ACIS possibilities this increment does not need to reach: the
///   flange/fitting symbols issue #299 was filed against are each a single solid lump.
///
/// Anything outside this scope is **refused with a specific message naming the record/face involved,
/// never approximated and never silently dropped** (ADR-051 (d), REQ-201) — the whole point of this
/// feature is that today's silent skip produces an empty block with no explanation.
