/// *derived* representation the display may regenerate at any quality without touching the solid
/// (#120: "changing tessellation quality should not modify the underlying solid").
///

/// bump, which makes immutability the precondition for undo working at all.

/// **What moves, and how.** The face's own plane translates. Every corner of it is then **re-solved
/// as the point where the planes of the faces meeting there now cross** — not translated along the
/// push. That distinction is the whole generality of the operation:
///
/// - on a **box**, sliding a corner straight up a vertical wall and intersecting three planes give
///   the same point, so the two agree;
/// - on a **pyramid or a wedge**, they do not. Every neighbour is slanted, so a corner slid straight
///   up leaves the sloping face it is supposed to sit on. Re-solving puts it exactly where the
///   slope, its other neighbour and the moved face now meet — which is what "push the base of a
///   pyramid" means, and what translation could only refuse.
///
/// A neighbouring face keeps its surface untouched throughout: its own vertices are re-solved *onto*
/// it, so it stays a plane its boundary actually lies on. That is the property `Validate` does not
/// check and this operation therefore guarantees itself.
///
/// **Refuses, by name and before building anything:**
/// - \ref Problem::PushPullFaceKindUnsupported — a curved wall. Moving a cylinder's wall is a radius
///   change and a different geometry problem: the caps' boundary arcs must be re-solved, not
///   translated. Its own increment.
/// - \ref Problem::PushPullDistanceZero — zero or non-finite. Reporting success for a move that did
///   not happen is worse than declining.
/// - \ref Problem::PushPullNeighbourCurved — a curved face meets the moved one. **This is the
///   load-bearing refusal**, and it was measured rather than argued. A curved surface is not a plane
///   to intersect, and \ref Validate cannot be relied on to notice the result: it checks topology
///   and degeneracy and has no test that a face's vertices lie on their own surface. With this check
///   removed, pushing a **cylinder's cap** by 3 builds a solid that Validate passes as **Ok** and
///   whose analytic volume comes out **863.938 against a true 1021.02** — 15% wrong, because the
///   wall still reports `height = 10` while its boundary sits at 13. See ADR-046 amendment (i).
/// - \ref Problem::PushPullVertexUnsolvable — a corner whose planes do not cross in one point, or
///   one where more than three faces meet and moving one leaves no point satisfying all of them.
///   Pushing a **pyramid's side face** is the honest example: its corners include the apex, where
///   four planes meet, and moving one of them would split that apex into several points. A topology
///   change, and a different operation.
/// - \ref Problem::PushPullResultInvalid — the moved solid failed validation: pushed so far it
///   collapsed, inverted, or degenerated a face. A real gesture, not a hypothetical.
///
/// **The result carries no recipe.** A pushed box is not the box its recipe describes, and a recipe
/// that no longer describes its solid reads as authoritative while being false (REQ-319 item 6).
/// **The topology is unchanged** — same vertex, edge and face counts, same indices — which is what
/// lets a REQ-318 sub-object reference survive the edit rather than expire (ADR-049).
